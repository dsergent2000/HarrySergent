 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4667.png" alt="“Those Early Days” 2      TRANS TASMAN PREPERATION  There was no concern about Smithy’s plans to fly the Tasman because of his Pacific experience, but Smithy was never the less taking no risks due to the extreme weather conditions that can take place in the Tasman Sea. After the Tasman flight Smithy said in his book “The Old Bus”...    “Although the distance from Sydney to Christchurch along the route we flew was but 1624 miles, which, the reader might think was comparatively short compared with our major hops across the Pacific, I was convinced in my own mind that we now had before us one of the most difficult and dangerous sea crossings in the world. I was determined, in consonance with the policy which I have always adopted, that we would run no risks which could be avoided.                                                                         The Tasman Sea has the reputation among seamen of being one of the wildest and stormiest seas on the globe. The bad weather and the fierce gales which assail it are notorious; it is a comparatively deserted stretch of ocean where one can expect no help, and the loss of two gallant lives, namely Hood and Moncrieff, who had previously met their death in a brave attempt to span the sea, confirmed me in my resolve to take no risks”.        With the Pacific experience in mind and Smithy’s concern about the Tasman weather and what they may expect with this flight, Smithy and Ulm had plenty to think about and prepare for.  Both airmen were going to make sure that everything possible would be done for them to have a successful flight across the Tasman Sea.                                             It was for this reason, there was a delay in time between when it became known that Smithy and Ulm were going to fly across the Tasman to New Zealand, and when the exact date for take-off would be made. It was a period of three months after the Pacific flight when eventually the flight took place. To the great number of people who were interested, the wait seemed to be an eternity, such was the interest especially after the Hood and Moncrieff tragedy.                                                                                                     However, the delay played a useful part in preparing for the two flights they had in mind, after the Pacific flight .One of the items in their pre flight plan was to get in touch with NZ, with regards to the most suitable aerodrome to land on after their Tasman crossing. This was high on the list because there were very limited aerodromes any where in those days, with a runway of 1000 yards, the minimum necessary  for the Southern Cross to land on.  Keeping in touch with the New Zealand Government on other matters was also important because goodwill was something they wanted (for their future) and this worked well as correspondence between the Governments of Australia and New Zealand will show.   The other matters that had to be attended to were a new Navigator and a new Wireless Operator. Both Americans who performed these tasks so well on the Pacific flight had returned to America.                                                             The Southern Cross also needed a complete service after the battering it got against the weather on the Pacific flight, and Smithy and Ulm wanted to be prepared for the Tasman Sea’s reputation. While this was being carried out Smithy asked for Cecil ‘Doc’ Maidment, the Wright Company’s chief field engineer (a man with a great reputation), to give the three engines a thorough overhaul after what they had also been through on the Pacific flight, and the hours of running prior to the Pacific take-off, although they had stood up remarkably well during that time. Doc Maidment installed the three engines in the Southern Cross, and the Wright company was more than willing to send Doc Maidment to Sydney, for an overhaul of the engines before Smithy embarked on any further distance flying.  It was at this time while the overhaul was being carried out at the RAAF base at Richmond that Doc Maidment had the assistance of Tommy Pethybridge, who was then in the RAAF.  Doc Maidment was so impressed with Tommy, he advised Smithy that he should try to see if he could employ him. To do this Tommy had to get a release from the RAAF which he did after paying a fee of 18 pounds.  Following this, Tommy became a life long friend of Smithy right up to when, together, they had  their fatal last flight.    THE SOUTHERN CROSS  Something should be said about the construction of the Southern Cross for those who are interested in this information and how this came about. There was a lot required from an aircraft that had to meet all the requirements for Smithy’s flights. Although so much has been said about Smithy’s famous pioneering flights, little has been said about the machine that carried Smithy and his crews on these journeys. The ‘Old Bus’ was an outstanding and reliable machine for that era and it was for this reason, that gave Smithy so much confidence before he embarked on every one of those early pioneering flights. The only time the “Old Bus” was not used was when Smithy flew solo in single engine aircraft.	        The biggest test for the Southern Cross was the distance between Kauai (a short distance from Honolulu)  and Suva a distance of 3,144 miles (5,060 Ks), the second stage of the Pacific flight. The weight of petrol with a safety margin required for this hop plus the weight of a crew of four, with their equipment was considerable. In addition, the Southern Cross had to take off from  what is known as Barking Sands, a beach in Kauai. The take-off was also a test for Smithy’s skills to  lift the aircraft off the beach with such a load.                                              This case was one of many for Smithy who had to take off or land where there was no proper aerodromes. Smithy had something to say about this after many flights were made and well after the take off at Barking Sands.  “I should here explain that probably the greatest problem of long distance flying is the question of landing and taking-off grounds. Long distance flying implies a very heavily laden machine, which in turn  necessitates a first class and lengthy runway, with ample scope for the machine to gather speed before she takes the air. If circumstances necessitate a forced landing on ground where these conditions are not fulfilled, the long distance flyer is at once in trouble. I write feelingly on this matter, because in the course of the many flights in the ‘Southern Cross’, I sometimes found myself in difficulties in making a landing, and still greater difficulties in taking off.”  When he wrote that, Smithy must have had in mind, the take off at Barking Sands as one of those difficult places for a take-off because, with the “Southern Cross” so heavily laden, he then lifted the heaviest weight ever lifted by an aircraft at that time and he did it off a beach. It’s another tribute to Smithy and the recognition of the ability of the “Southern Cross”, to stand up to what it had been planned and built to do.   The Southern Cross was a Fokker Hybrid (and although it was never described as such), built from two Fokker aircraft and this is an interesting story of how the development of the Old Bus came about. One of the final assembly was a three engine Fokker F7  monoplane which was built especially for use in Alaska and the other, a smaller single engine Fokker. The F7 Fokker had been damaged in a crash on rough ice and shipped to the Boeing factory in Seattle, together with a single engine Fokker (which had also been damaged) for repairs. The good wing of the F7 was attached to the fuselage of the single motor Fokker aircraft, resulting in a new type of aircraft which then became the Southern Cross. It was sold to Smithy and Ulm for 3000 pounds without engines.  The next move was to decide on the most suitable engines required for what lay ahead and this did not take long before Smithy decided on the Wright Whirlwind. It had already built up a reputation for reliability and Smithy had been aware of these engines being installed in several aircraft that carried out very successful flights including the Ryan aircraft used by Lindbergh on his trans- Atlantic flight. The 9 cylinder radial, 220 HP, J5C model was the latest development of that series (previous engines in that series were only 200 HP).    Smithy and Ulm were lucky to get early delivery of the three engines they immediately required, due to the orders for them at that time. Wright Whirlwind had about 90 engines on order waiting to be delivered before they could deliver the three engines required for the Southern Cross, such was the demand. It was  a stroke of luck that allowed Smithy and Ulm to get their three engines earlier as a result of making the right contacts, and seeing the right people who understood their urgent need for what they had planned, and they did every thing possible to assist.  The extra 60 Horsepower from these late model engines was important. It was a further help considering so much was required to lift the Southern Cross off the ground with all the fuel required for the long flight between Kauai (a short distance from Honolulu) and Suva a distance of 3128 miles (5,034 Kms). Smithy had the following to say about this, “It was an extreme case of heavy load flying, in which two main factors predominated. One was the wing loading, this being the amount of gross load carried per square foot of available wing surface; the other factor was the power loading - the gross load carried per available horsepower. There is, of course, a limit to which a plane can be “composite loaded”, and flown. In this case our wing loading in pounds per square foot was 23.2 which, added to the power loading in pounds per horse power, which was 26.3, gave a total or composite load of 49.5 – this being then the heaviest composite load ever lifted by any plane”.  Smithy also commented on the problem of handling over weight aircraft, “In the course of these preliminary flights we had discovered many matters which required adjustment, notably what is termed “tail flutter”. Tail flutter is a vibration set up in the rear control surfaces of a machine heavily loaded and flying too slowly; or conversely of a machine flying lightly loaded and too fast.”  It is worth quoting what they carried out to help rectify some of these problems, because there was so much to consider before they could finally decide what the maximum amount of fuel which could be carried, “We strengthened the whole tail end of the body, fitted extra vertical members at points of maximum stress in the fuselage, installed special flexible petrol pipes to withstand the vibration, built in stronger axles to take the great weight and our wheels and tyres were of especially strong construction. Furthermore, on previous test flights, we had dumped over 3000 gallons of petrol while in the air so that the plane would not be subjected to undue strain when landing”.  After Smithy and Ulm took delivery of the final assembly of the two Fokkers from Sir Hubert Wilkins (less engines). After new engines were installed by Doc Maidment of the Wright company, and the above-mentioned modifications were carried out, they knew they had an excellent aircraft for their huge flights, and this was what Smithy had to say about what was now the Southern Cross. “The Merit of Fokker’s design is that he was the first to utilise the internally braced “thick wing”, a principle of great value on account of the high lift which it produces. After a prolonged analysis of the best flying performance already recorded in which power and endurance were combined, we found that the Fokker plane was amongst the most successful, and the Wright Whirlwind the most reliable engine. Furthermore, a Fokker plane would enable four of us to make the flight, thereby allowing not only a navigator, but also a wireless operator also to be carried”.  The specifications of the Southern Cross will be of interest to many, as the wing and the fuel tank capacity were of particular interest:  Wingspan: 71 feet 8 and ½ inches (21.857 Meters)                                                                                 Full cantilever internally braced three-ply wood construction                                                                                        Maximum chord of wing: 12 feet 6 inches (3.81 meters) Maximum thickness: 33 inches (83.82cm)  This allowed four tanks each holding 96 gallons to be installed in the wing:  Tank under the pilot’s seat held 107 gallons    Main tank in fuselage held 807 gallons Total fuel capacity 1298 American gallons (4,913 Litres)  With all this data Smithy had on fuel capacity and engine consumption and the lifting power of the Southern Cross, he was able to carry out his estimation of fuel consumption with a margin of safety for the longest Pacific flight.                     At full throttle the engines gave 1800 r.p.m. giving the Southern Cross a speed of 120 miles per hour. Throttled back to 1600 r.p.m. speed was 94 miles per hour and the fuel consumption of each engine was 11 gallons per hour.  For safety purposes, Smithy allowed for an average speed of only 90 miles per hour at 1600 r.p.m. with a fuel consumption of 32 gallons per hour. He calculated his tanks of 1298 gallons, would give a range of 40 hours and 30 minutes. Under normal air conditions this would give a range of 3645 miles which would safely get him over the longest hop between Kauai in the Hawaiian islands and Suva, a distance of 3128 miles estimated to give him a safe margin of 500 miles, and Smithy’s estimation of fuel consumption proved to be correct.  Although Smithy and Ulm had complete confidence in the Southern Cross before the Pacific flight, the success of this flight gave them even more admiration for the Old Bus and the confidence they needed for the Tasman flight. It must be remembered that we are discussing a flight in 1928, and the two aircraft that made the Southern Cross were built long before 1928.                              After the Pacific flight another complete service check of the airframe was carried out at the RAAF base at Richmond, and when this and the engine overhaul was complete, the aircraft was in top condition and ready for the Tasman flight.   It was now time to select the Navigator and Wireless Operator for the Tasman flight. Their requirement was to have a qualified Navigator and a Wireless operator of the same calibre that they had on the Pacific crossing. The Navigator and Wireless operator on that flight had considerable experience operating as a Marine Navigator and a Marine Wireless Operator, but neither had any previous experience operating their skills on an aircraft before that. There was no Navigator or Wireless Operator at that time, who had to use their skills flying over very long distances of water such as in the case between Oakland and the Pacific island of Honolulu, a distance of 2,408 miles (3875 Kms) and between Honolulu and Suva 3144 miles (5060 Ks) as previously mentioned. To understand the significance of this achievement I suggest that readers should have a look at a map of the Pacific and these two islands would be shown as no more than little specks in the ocean. However, both men proved very efficient in what they had to carry out.  Of course the blind flying skills of Smithy must also never be forgotten as blind flying was so important then. The instructions coming from the Navigator had to be adhered to precisely, and in bad weather where visibility is reduced to blindness, the accuracy of the pilot carrying out those instructions was vital. There were many entries about this in his logbook (especially on the ocean crossings) and this is how Smithy described blind flying, &quot;In blind flying you can see through the wind shield but not beyond it, because there your visibility ends. Your sights, therefore, is of no value. You are blindfolded. In blind flying you can hear but only the roar of the engines. Your hearing, therefore, is of little or no value since you are deafened by the continual noise. Nor can you feel your way forward, since there is nothing to feel, and you are flying on at high speed. The sense of smell is of no value in such circumstances, nor is that of taste. Consequently blind flying comes to this - that of the five senses, only one is of any use and that is the ability to see the instruments in the board&quot;. When visibility is reduced to blindness, the accuracy of the pilot carrying out these instructions is vital and it was especially so in the case of the Pacific flight. One small error while blind flying and all the good work of the navigator is lost, and the flight would end up in tragedy. Seated in the cockpit with the top of each side opened, in cramped conditions for hours at a time, and a lot of those periods in bad weather, with no normal toilet facilities and at the same time having to keep the aircraft strictly on course, requiring total concentration the whole time. The pilot’s control was a physical and mental endurance test which allowed for no mistakes, making this was an amazing achievement, especially when it was at a time when aircraft were not fitted with auto controls.    It is interesting to have the comments of Charles Ulm on blind flying (which he wrote in his logbook), as mentioned in “Caesar of the Skies” by Flying Officer Beau Sheil, “Rainstorms loomed ahead. Smithy flew round one storm. I flew round another. Now they seem to be closing in all round, so Smithy has the controls again, flying under rainstorms uses more petrol so does climbing above them. Smithy began to fly right through them-blind. Smithy had so many experiences blind flying on the Pacific Flight that it concerned Lyon and Warner at one stage, and they sent up a note to Smithy &quot;What the hell are you doing now&quot; and &quot;Will the gas hold out&quot;. Another entry in Ulm&#39;s logbook was, &quot;locked in the clouds again, Smithy flying blind and trying to get above the murk. This plays hell with gasoline consumption. 7.15 a.m. Oh, what a cheerless dawn. Rain, cold and blind flying at 8000 feet”. Later when the dash-light on the instrument panel failed, Ulm held the torch on the instruments while Smithy flew blind and he still had to keep the aircraft on an accurate course, which he did. Smithy became so efficient at blind flying, it would take a lot of space in our book to record this aspect, let alone his other flying skills. This was acknowledged when Lyon and Warner said after they landed at Suva, “Smithy sure knows his onions at this blind flying and when we get back to America we will have that guy Smithy made President of America for his night flying”. I ask again, that readers should remember this when they come to the chapter of my comments about Scotty Allan&#39;s book, “Scotty Allan Australia&#39;s Flying Scotsman”.     When wanting to get above bad weather, there was a limit on how high they could fly, because the aircraft in those early days did not have the power to climb high enough to avoid bad weather. In addition the aircraft were not designed or constructed strong enough to have the cabin and cockpit at a pressure that would allow the human body to function normally.   Modern aircraft were not pressurised to maintain normal atmospheric pressure, until the De Havilland Comet 1 carried out its first test flight, in July 1949. I remember that time well because I was still working for BOAC, who had these aircraft on order, and later brought them into service in May, 1952. At that time De Havilland was well ahead of any other manufacturer, and at first the Comet operated with great success. However, De Havilland paid a huge price for being the pioneer of pressurised aircraft, because two came apart due to metal fatigue, brought about by the expansion and contraction of metals on the fuselage. This was a problem not experienced before, which set De Havilland back until their Comet 4 went into service in 1958, and then their competitors caught up. It was during this period that passengers realised the comfort of jet aircraft, which had the power to climb to great heights to avoid bad weather, and relax in cabins with the air pressure controlled at a pressure, that humans could tolerate.                   It was approximately 20 years after the Comet’s first test flight, that the first test flight of the Concorde was made. When the Concorde actually came into service, it had the power to reach heights so great, that it was possible for passengers to see the deep blue of outer space and the curve of the earth. This achievement inclined people to forget the difficulties of Smithy’s and other aviators’ pioneering days. The importance of Smithy with his blind flying and Lyon the navigator and Warner his colleague and partner in Navigation has been mentioned but we cannot forget Charles Ulm, Smithy&#39;s Co-Pilot, for his organising ability. This is what Smithy had to say about his flying mate, “To my old flying colleague, Charles T.P. Ulm without whose genius for organisation, and courageous spirit many flights in the, &#39;Southern Cross&#39; could never have been achieved. C.K.S.” Apart from planning, Ulm was also Co-Pilot on the Pacific flight where he flew for over 30 hours while Smithy flew for over 50 hours. However, it is important to know that aircraft take offs with extremely heavy loads of fuel for long distance flying, can be very tricky, needing the skills of a very good pilot. In this case where Smithy and Charles Ulm flew together the onerous task of lift-off under these conditions on temporary fields or beaches, was always left to Smithy. Although at the end of a flight the aircraft will be much lighter, some of the places where pilots had to land, also needed great skill, and in all cases Smithy carried out the landings with the Southern Cross while he was associated with Charles Ulm. The landing at Albert Park in Suva was an example of Smithy’s skills and the way he handled it and got out of trouble, which could have been a disaster if in the hands of a less qualified pilot. This is something that was talked about for many years.                                                                                                        Now back to the preparations for the Tasman flight and I trust that the experiences I have mentioned about Smithy and Ulm’s earlier experiences, will allow readers to understand why such care and detail had to be considered, before embarking on the Tasman flight, and the importance of a suitable appointment of a Navigator and Wireless operator.   As it happened there were plenty of very experienced Australian and New Zealand Marine Navigators and Radio Operators, due to the very active shipping services between the two countries at that time. However, Smithy and Ulm decided to ask the Governments of the two countries to help them choose who would be their Radio Operator, for diplomatic reasons.                                         It was obvious that the experience of the initial flight to New Zealand was twofold. Smithy and Charles Ulm required certain information before they could safely embark on the Tasman flight, but they also wanted the Governments of both countries to get involved, because finally it was an airline that they were aiming for, that would give faster mail delivery and quicker transportation of people between the two countries." title="" style="left:34px;top:271px;width:821px;height:7368px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 495.87px;">and what they may expect with this flight, Smithy and Ulm had plenty to think about </span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 704.77px;">However, the delay played a useful part in preparing for the two flights they had in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 723.76px;">mind, after the Pacific flight .One of the items in their pre flight plan was to get in touch </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 742.75px;">with NZ, with regards to the most suitable aerodrome to land on after their Tasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 761.74px;">crossing. This was high on the list because there were very limited aerodromes any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 780.73px;">where in those days, with a runway of 1000 yards, the minimum necessary  for the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 799.72px;">Southern Cross to land on.  Keeping in touch with the New Zealand Government on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 818.71px;">other matters was also important because goodwill was something they wanted (for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 837.7px;">their future) and this worked well as correspondence between the Governments of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 856.69px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Australia and New Zealand will show. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 894.51px;">The other matters that had to be attended to were a new Navigator and a new </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 913.5px;">Wireless Operator. Both Americans who performed these tasks so well on the Pacific </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 932.49px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">flight had returned to America.</span></span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 970.47px;">The Southern Cross also needed a complete service after the battering it got against </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 989.46px;">the weather on the Pacific flight, and Smithy and Ulm wanted to be prepared for the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1008.45px;">Tasman Sea’s reputation. While this was being carried out Smithy asked for Cecil ‘Doc’ </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1027.45px;">Maidment, the Wright Company’s chief field engineer (a man with a great reputation), </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1046.44px;">to give the three engines a thorough overhaul after what they had also been through </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1065.43px;">on the Pacific flight, and the hours of running prior to the Pacific take-off, although they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1084.42px;">had stood up remarkably well during that time. Doc Maidment installed the three </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1103.41px;">engines in the Southern Cross, and the Wright company was more than willing to send </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1122.4px;">Doc Maidment to Sydney, for an overhaul of the engines before Smithy embarked on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1141.39px;">any further distance flying.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1179.37px;">It was at this time while the overhaul was being</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1198.36px;">carried out at the RAAF base at Richmond that</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1217.35px;">Doc Maidment had the assistance of Tommy</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1236.34px;">Pethybridge, who was then in the RAAF.  Doc</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1255.33px;">Maidment was so impressed with Tommy, he</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1274.32px;">advised Smithy that he should try to see if he</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1293.31px;">could employ him. To do this Tommy had to get</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1312.31px;">a release from the RAAF which he did after</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1331.3px;">paying a fee of 18 pounds.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1369.28px;">Following this, Tommy became a life long friend</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1388.27px;">of Smithy right up to when, together, they had </span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1500.76px;">Something should be said about the</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1538.75px;">who are interested in this information and how</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1557.74px;">this came about. There was a lot required from</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1576.73px;">an aircraft that had to meet all the requirements</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1595.72px;">for Smithy’s flights. Although so much has been said about Smithy’s famous </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1614.71px;">pioneering flights, little has been said about the machine that carried Smithy and his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1633.7px;">crews on these journeys. The ‘Old Bus’ was an outstanding and reliable machine for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1652.69px;">that era and it was for this reason, that gave Smithy so much confidence before he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1671.68px;">embarked on every one of those early pioneering flights. The only time the “Old Bus” </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1690.67px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">was not used was when Smithy flew solo in single engine aircraft.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 529.13px; top: 1690.67px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">      </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1728.49px;">The biggest test for the Southern Cross was the distance between Kauai (a short </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1747.48px;">distance from Honolulu)  and Suva a distance of 3,144 miles (5,060 Ks), the second </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1766.47px;">stage of the Pacific flight. The weight of petrol with a safety margin required for this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1785.46px;">hop plus the weight of a crew of four, with their equipment was considerable. In </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1804.45px;">addition, the Southern Cross had to take off from  what is known as Barking Sands, a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1823.44px;">beach in Kauai. The take-off was also a test for Smithy’s skills to  lift the aircraft off the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1842.43px;">beach with such a load.</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1880.41px;">This case was one of many for Smithy who had to take off or land where there was no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1899.4px;">proper aerodromes. Smithy had something to say about this after many flights were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1918.39px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">made and well after the take off at Barking Sands.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1956.21px;">“I should here explain that probably the greatest problem of long distance flying is the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1975.2px;">question of landing and taking-off grounds. Long distance flying implies a very heavily </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1994.19px;">laden machine, which in turn  necessitates a first class and lengthy runway, with ample </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2013.18px;">scope for the machine to gather speed before she takes the air. If circumstances </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2032.17px;">necessitate a forced landing on ground where these conditions are not fulfilled, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2051.16px;">long distance flyer is at once in trouble. I write feelingly on this matter, because in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2070.15px;">course of the many flights in the ‘Southern Cross’, I sometimes found myself in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2089.14px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">difficulties in making a landing, and still greater difficulties in taking off.”</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2126.96px;">When he wrote that, Smithy must have had in mind, the take off at Barking Sands as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2145.95px;">one of those difficult places for a take-off because, with the “Southern Cross” so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2164.94px;">heavily laden, he then lifted the heaviest weight ever lifted by an aircraft at that time </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2183.93px;">and he did it off a beach. It’s another tribute to Smithy and the recognition of the ability </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2202.92px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">of the “Southern Cross”, to stand up to what it had been planned and built to do. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2240.74px;">The Southern Cross was a Fokker Hybrid</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2259.73px;">(and although it was never described as</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2278.72px;">such), built from two Fokker aircraft and</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2297.71px;">this is an interesting story of how the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2316.7px;">development of the Old Bus came about.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2335.69px;">One of the final assembly was a three</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2354.68px;">engine Fokker F7  monoplane which was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2373.67px;">built especially for use in Alaska and the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2392.66px;">other, a smaller single engine Fokker.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2411.65px;">The F7 Fokker had been damaged in a</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2430.65px;">crash on rough ice and shipped to the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2449.64px;">Boeing factory in Seattle, together with</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2468.63px;">a single engine Fokker (which had also</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2487.62px;">been damaged) for repairs. The good</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2506.61px;">wing of the F7 was attached to the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2525.6px;">fuselage of the single motor Fokker</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2544.59px;">aircraft, resulting in a new type of aircraft which then became the Southern Cross.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2563.58px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">It was sold to Smithy and Ulm for 3000 pounds without engines.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2601.4px;">The next move was to decide on the most suitable engines required for what lay ahead </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2620.39px;">and this did not take long before Smithy decided on the Wright Whirlwind. It had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2639.38px;">already built up a reputation for reliability and Smithy had been aware of these engines </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2658.37px;">being installed in several aircraft that carried out very successful flights including the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2677.36px;">Ryan aircraft used by Lindbergh on his trans- Atlantic flight. The 9 cylinder radial, 220 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2696.35px;">HP,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2715.34px;">J5C model was the latest development of that series (previous engines in that series </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2734.33px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">were only 200 HP).  </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2772.15px;">Smithy and Ulm were lucky to get early delivery of the three engines they immediately </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2791.14px;">required, due to the orders for them at that time. Wright Whirlwind had about 90 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2810.13px;">engines on order waiting to be delivered before they could deliver the three engines </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2829.12px;">required for the Southern Cross, such was the demand. It was  a stroke of luck that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2848.11px;">allowed Smithy and Ulm to get their three engines earlier as a result of making the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2867.1px;">right contacts, and seeing the right people who understood their urgent need for what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2886.09px;">they had planned, and they did every thing possible to assist.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2928.71px;">The extra 60 Horsepower from these late model engines was important. It was a further help </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2946.58px;">considering so much was required to lift the Southern Cross off the ground with all the fuel </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2964.45px;">required for the long flight between Kauai (a short distance from Honolulu) and Suva a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2982.33px;">distance of 3128 miles (5,034 Kms). Smithy had the following to say about this, “It was an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3000.2px;">extreme case of heavy load flying, in which two main factors predominated. One was the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3018.07px;">wing loading, this being the amount of gross load carried per square foot of available wing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3035.95px;">surface; the other factor was the power loading - the gross load carried per available </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3053.82px;">horsepower. There is, of course, a limit to which a plane can be “composite loaded”, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3071.69px;">flown. In this case our wing loading in pounds per square foot was 23.2 which, added to the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3089.57px;">power loading in pounds per horse power, which was 26.3, gave a total or composite load of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3107.44px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">49.5 – this being then the heaviest composite load ever lifted by any plane”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3148.94px;">Smithy also commented on the problem of handling over weight aircraft, “In the course of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3166.81px;">these preliminary flights we had discovered many matters which required adjustment, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3184.68px;">notably what is termed “tail flutter”. Tail flutter is a vibration set up in the rear control </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3202.56px;">surfaces of a machine heavily loaded and flying too slowly; or conversely of a machine flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3220.43px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">lightly loaded and too fast.”</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3261.93px;">It is worth quoting what they carried out to help rectify some of these problems, because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3279.8px;">there was so much to consider before they could finally decide what the maximum amount </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3297.67px;">of fuel which could be carried, “We strengthened the whole tail end of the body, fitted extra </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3315.55px;">vertical members at points of maximum stress in the fuselage, installed special flexible </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3333.42px;">petrol pipes to withstand the vibration, built in stronger axles to take the great weight and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3351.29px;">our wheels and tyres were of especially strong construction. Furthermore, on previous test </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3369.17px;">flights, we had dumped over 3000 gallons of petrol while in the air so that the plane would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3387.04px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">not be subjected to undue strain when landing”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3428.54px;">After Smithy and Ulm took delivery of the final assembly of the two Fokkers from Sir Hubert </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3446.41px;">Wilkins (less engines). After new engines were installed by Doc Maidment of the Wright </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3464.28px;">company, and the above-mentioned modifications were carried out, they knew they had an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3482.16px;">excellent aircraft for their huge flights, and this was what Smithy had to say about what was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3500.03px;">now the Southern Cross. “The Merit of Fokker’s design is that he was the first to utilise the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3517.9px;">internally braced “thick wing”, a principle of great value on account of the high lift which it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3535.78px;">produces. After a prolonged analysis of the best flying performance already recorded in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3553.65px;">which power and endurance were combined, we found that the Fokker plane was amongst </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3571.52px;">the most successful, and the Wright Whirlwind the most reliable engine. Furthermore, a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3589.4px;">Fokker plane would enable four of us to make the flight, thereby allowing not only a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3607.27px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">navigator, but also a wireless operator also to be carried”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3648.77px;">The specifications of the Southern Cross will be of interest to many, as the wing and the fuel </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3666.64px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">tank capacity were of particular interest:</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3708.14px;">Wingspan: 71 feet 8 and ½ inches (21.857 Meters)                                                                                 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3726.01px;">Full cantilever internally braced three-ply wood construction                                                                                        </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3743.89px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">Maximum chord of wing: 12 feet 6 inches (3.81 meters)</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3761.76px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">Maximum thickness: 33 inches (83.82cm)</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3803.26px;">This allowed four tanks each holding 96 gallons to be installed in the wing:</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3844.75px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">Tank under the pilot’s seat held 107 gallons   </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3862.63px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">Main tank in fuselage held 807 gallons</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3880.5px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">Total fuel capacity 1298 American gallons (4,913 Litres)</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3922px;">With all this data Smithy had on fuel capacity and engine consumption and the lifting power </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3939.87px;">of the Southern Cross, he was able to carry out his estimation of fuel consumption with a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3957.74px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">margin of safety for the longest Pacific flight. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3975.62px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">                  </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3993.49px;">At full throttle the engines gave 1800 r.p.m. giving the Southern Cross a speed of 120 miles </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4011.36px;">per hour. Throttled back to 1600 r.p.m. speed was 94 miles per hour and the fuel </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4029.24px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">consumption of each engine was 11 gallons per hour.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4070.73px;">For safety purposes, Smithy allowed for an average speed of only 90 miles per hour at 1600 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4088.61px;">r.p.m. with a fuel consumption of 32 gallons per hour. He calculated his tanks of 1298 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4106.48px;">gallons, would give a range of 40 hours and 30 minutes. Under normal air conditions this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4124.35px;">would give a range of 3645 miles which would safely get him over the longest hop between </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4142.23px;">Kauai in the Hawaiian islands and Suva, a distance of 3128 miles estimated to give him a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4160.1px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">safe margin of 500 miles, and Smithy’s estimation of fuel consumption proved to be correct.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4201.6px;">Although Smithy and Ulm had complete confidence in the Southern Cross before the Pacific </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4219.47px;">flight, the success of this flight gave them even more admiration for the Old Bus and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4237.35px;">confidence they needed for the Tasman flight. It must be remembered that we are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4255.22px;">discussing a flight in 1928, and the two aircraft that made the Southern Cross were built </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4273.09px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">long before 1928.                           </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4338.21px;">After the Pacific flight another complete service check of the airframe was carried out at the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4356.09px;">RAAF base at Richmond, and when this and the engine overhaul was complete, the aircraft </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4373.96px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">was in top condition and ready for the Tasman flight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4391.83px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style=""> </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4409.71px;">It was now time to select the Navigator and Wireless Operator for the Tasman flight. Their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4427.58px;">requirement was to have a qualified Navigator and a Wireless operator of the same calibre </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4445.45px;">that they had on the Pacific crossing. The Navigator and Wireless operator on that flight had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4463.33px;">considerable experience operating as a Marine Navigator and a Marine Wireless Operator, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4481.2px;">but neither had any previous experience operating their skills on an aircraft before that. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4499.07px;">There was no Navigator or Wireless Operator at that time, who had to use their skills flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4516.95px;">over very long distances of water such as in the case between Oakland and the Pacific </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4534.82px;">island of Honolulu, a distance of 2,408 miles (3875 Kms) and between Honolulu and Suva </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4552.69px;">3144 miles (5060 Ks) as previously mentioned. To understand the significance of this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4570.57px;">achievement I suggest that readers should have a look at a map of the Pacific and these </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4588.44px;">two islands would be shown as no more than little specks in the ocean. However, both men </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4606.31px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">proved very efficient in what they had to carry out.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4647.81px;">Of course the blind flying skills of Smithy must also never be forgotten as blind flying was so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4668.36px;">important then. The instructions coming from the Navigator had to be adhered to precisely, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4688.92px;">and in bad weather where visibility is reduced to blindness, the accuracy of the pilot carrying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4709.47px;">out those instructions was vital. There were many entries about this in his logbook </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4730.02px;">(especially on the ocean crossings) and this is how Smithy described blind flying, "In blind </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4750.58px;">flying you can see through the wind shield but not beyond it, because there your visibility </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4771.13px;">ends. Your sights, therefore, is of no value. You are blindfolded. In blind flying you can hear </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4791.68px;">but only the roar of the engines. Your hearing, therefore, is of little or no value since you are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4812.24px;">deafened by the continual noise. Nor can you feel your way forward, since there is nothing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4832.79px;">to feel, and you are flying on at high speed. The sense of smell is of no value in such </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4853.34px;">circumstances, nor is that of taste. Consequently blind flying comes to this - that of the five </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4873.9px;">senses, only one is of any use and that is the ability to see the instruments in the board".</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4907.78px;">When visibility is reduced to blindness, the accuracy of the pilot carrying out these </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4928.34px;">instructions is vital and it was especially so in the case of the Pacific flight. One small error </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4948.89px;">while blind flying and all the good work of the navigator is lost, and the flight would end up in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4969.44px;">tragedy. Seated in the cockpit with the top of each side opened, in cramped conditions for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4990px;">hours at a time, and a lot of those periods in bad weather, with no normal toilet facilities and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5010.55px;">at the same time having to keep the aircraft strictly on course, requiring total concentration </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5031.1px;">the whole time. The pilot’s control was a physical and mental endurance test which allowed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5051.66px;">for no mistakes, making this was an amazing achievement, especially when it was at a time </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5072.21px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">when aircraft were not fitted with auto controls.   </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5106.1px;">It is interesting to have the comments of Charles Ulm on blind flying (which he wrote in his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5126.65px;">logbook), as mentioned in “Caesar of the Skies” by Flying Officer Beau Sheil, “Rainstorms </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5147.2px;">loomed ahead. Smithy flew round one storm. I flew round another. Now they seem to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5167.76px;">closing in all round, so Smithy has the controls again, flying under rainstorms uses more </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5188.31px;">petrol so does climbing above them. Smithy began to fly right through them-blind. Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5208.86px;">had so many experiences blind flying on the Pacific Flight that it concerned Lyon and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5229.42px;">Warner at one stage, and they sent up a note to Smithy "What the hell are you doing now" </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5249.97px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">and "Will the gas hold out".</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5283.86px;">Another entry in Ulm's logbook was, "locked in the clouds again, Smithy flying blind and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5304.41px;">trying to get above the murk. This plays hell with gasoline consumption. 7.15 a.m. Oh, what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5324.96px;">a cheerless dawn. Rain, cold and blind flying at 8000 feet”. Later when the dash-light on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5345.52px;">instrument panel failed, Ulm held the torch on the instruments while Smithy flew blind and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5366.07px;">he still had to keep the aircraft on an accurate course, which he did. Smithy became so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5386.62px;">efficient at blind flying, it would take a lot of space in our book to record this aspect, let alone </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5407.18px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">his other flying skills.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5441.06px;">This was acknowledged when Lyon and Warner said after they landed at Suva, “Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5461.62px;">sure knows his onions at this blind flying and when we get back to America we will have that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5482.17px;">guy Smithy made President of America for his night flying”. I ask again, that readers should </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5502.72px;">remember this when they come to the chapter of my comments about Scotty Allan's book, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5523.28px;">“Scotty Allan Australia's Flying Scotsman”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5557.16px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">   </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5591.05px;">When wanting to get above bad weather, there was a limit on how high they could fly, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5608.92px;">because the aircraft in those early days did not have the power to climb high enough to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5626.8px;">avoid bad weather. In addition the aircraft were not designed or constructed strong enough </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5644.67px;">to have the cabin and cockpit at a pressure that would allow the human body to function </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5662.54px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">normally. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5704.04px;">Modern aircraft were not pressurised to maintain normal atmospheric pressure, until the De </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5724.59px;">Havilland Comet 1 carried out its first test flight, in July 1949. I remember that time well </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5745.15px;">because I was still working for BOAC, who had these aircraft on order, and later brought </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5765.7px;">them into service in May, 1952. At that time De Havilland was well ahead of any other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5786.25px;">manufacturer, and at first the Comet operated with great success. However, De Havilland </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5806.81px;">paid a huge price for being the pioneer of pressurised aircraft, because two came apart due </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5827.36px;">to metal fatigue, brought about by the expansion and contraction of metals on the fuselage. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5847.91px;">This was a problem not experienced before, which set De Havilland back until their Comet 4 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5868.47px;">went into service in 1958, and then their competitors caught up. It was during this period </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5889.02px;">that passengers realised the comfort of jet aircraft, which had the power to climb to great </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5909.57px;">heights to avoid bad weather, and relax in cabins with the air pressure controlled at a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5930.13px;">pressure, that humans could tolerate. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6133.45px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style=""> </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6519.43px;">It was approximately 20 years after the Comet’s first test flight, that the first test flight of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6539.98px;">Concorde was made. When the Concorde actually came into service, it had the power to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6560.54px;">reach heights so great, that it was possible for passengers to see the deep blue of outer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6581.09px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">space and the curve of the earth.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6614.98px;">This achievement inclined people to forget the difficulties of Smithy’s and other aviators’ </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6635.53px;">pioneering days. The importance of Smithy with his blind flying and Lyon the navigator and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6656.08px;">Warner his colleague and partner in Navigation has been mentioned but we cannot forget </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6676.64px;">Charles Ulm, Smithy's Co-Pilot, for his organising ability. This is what Smithy had to say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6697.19px;">about his flying mate, “To my old flying colleague, Charles T.P. Ulm without whose genius for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6717.74px;">organisation, and courageous spirit many flights in the, 'Southern Cross' could never have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6738.3px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">been achieved. C.K.S.”</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6772.18px;">Apart from planning, Ulm was also Co-Pilot on the Pacific flight where he flew for over 30 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6792.74px;">hours while Smithy flew for over 50 hours. However, it is important to know that aircraft take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6813.29px;">offs with extremely heavy loads of fuel for long distance flying, can be very tricky, needing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6833.84px;">the skills of a very good pilot. In this case where Smithy and Charles Ulm flew together the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6854.4px;">onerous task of lift-off under these conditions on temporary fields or beaches, was always </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6874.95px;">left to Smithy. Although at the end of a flight the aircraft will be much lighter, some of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6895.5px;">places where pilots had to land, also needed great skill, and in all cases Smithy carried out </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6916.06px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">the landings with the Southern Cross while he was associated with Charles Ulm.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6949.94px;">The landing at Albert Park in Suva was an example of Smithy’s skills and the way he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6970.5px;">handled it and got out of trouble, which could have been a disaster if in the hands of a less </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6991.05px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">qualified pilot. This is something that was talked about for many years. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7024.94px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">                                                                                                     </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7042.81px;">Now back to the preparations for the Tasman flight and I trust that the experiences I have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7060.68px;">mentioned about Smithy and Ulm’s earlier experiences, will allow readers to understand </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7078.56px;">why such care and detail had to be considered, before embarking on the Tasman flight, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7096.43px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">the importance of a suitable appointment of a Navigator and Wireless operator. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7137.93px;">As it happened there were plenty of very experienced Australian and New Zealand Marine </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7155.8px;">Navigators and Radio Operators, due to the very active shipping services between the two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7173.67px;">countries at that time. However, Smithy and Ulm decided to ask the Governments of the two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7191.55px;">countries to help them choose who would be their Radio Operator, for diplomatic reasons.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s31 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7209.42px;"><span class="xr_s30 xr_italic" style="">                                       </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7227.29px;">It was obvious that the experience of the initial flight to New Zealand was twofold. Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7245.17px;">and Charles Ulm required certain information before they could safely embark on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7263.04px;">Tasman flight, but they also wanted the Governments of both countries to get involved, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7280.91px;">because finally it was an airline that they were aiming for, that would give faster mail delivery </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7298.79px;">and quicker transportation of people between the two countries.</span>
