 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4700.png" alt="“Engine Maintenance whilst Flying”   I remember this occasion very well when I was a passenger on a Qantas Flying Boat aircraft between Surabaya in the Netherland Indies (as it was known at the time), and Darwin on the 29th June 1940. No, this was not a P.G. Taylor heroic act, just an entry into the inside of the wing (not the outside) to carry out adjustments on three engines.  I was on a transfer from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, a predecessor of British Airways) from Calcutta (where I had been employed as Station Engineer) to Tasman Airways, a predecessor of Air New Zealand. It was a custom in those days with BOAC and Qantas, who had a strong association, that the Captain be notified of any engineering staff who was a passenger on board, and who may be able to rectify a problem at a refuelling stop if there was no engineer stationed there. However, it was possible on this occasion to rectify all three problems while flying and it was most unusual that this applied to three engines, although it was not a serious threat to safety. It was difficult for the captain to synchronise all four engines as a result of a throttle problem with two of the engines and an electrical problem on the RPM generator.  The aircraft was a Short S23 Class flying boat and the steward on board approached me and asked me whether I was Harry Sergent, and told me the Captain would like to see me, and would I go upstairs to see him. It should be mentioned that this short flying boat had an upper deck where the crew of Captain, First officer and Radio officer were situated, and at the rear of them at mid-ship was where the mail was stored.  The Captain said to me “I am having a problem with synchronising the starboard outer engine and he thought I may be able to rectify this problem, if I could crawl out through the wing to carry out an adjustment on the Exactor control which operated the throttle.  The plan was for me to carry out these adjustments, as the First Officer would stand at the entrance to the inner part of the wing near the freight department, where he could see both the Captain and me at the same time. The Captain would give him the signal to pass on to me, when the adjustment that I made was okay.  He further said “There is a pair of overalls on top of the mail”, you could slip these on to protect your clothing, which was handy seeing that I was dressed as a traveller. When normal maintenance over water was carried out on this type of flying boat, a section of the wing’s leading edge on both sides of the engine is hinged so it can be swung open and lowered, and when in the lower position equipment can be attached to carry a plank to stand on and work on the front of the engine. When the leading edge was open it was much easier to get inside the wing to work on the rear of the engine, although it was still confined to some extent, but when I had to crawl out of the starboard outer engine, the leading edges of the wing locked up as in flight, making it was not so easy.  I realised that the bulkhead panel at the rear of the engine (which it was necessary to remove to get at the extractor controls) would have had some pressure on it while in flight, and I had to be aware of this when I removed the fasteners holding it in position. After I opened the fasteners holding the bulkhead panel, the pressure was more than I expected and the bulkhead was hot. After the adjustments were carried out and the Captain was satisfied I had to get back, and this was not easy as there was no room to turn around, so I had to crawl backwards.  When I got out of the wing the Captain thanked me and asked if I would like to sit in the First Officer’s seat while he went downstairs to have a cup of tea or coffee. We had an interesting chat and after the First office returned I went back to my seat. I was not there long when I got another call to go back upstairs. The Captain said “I have been getting fluctuations with the rev counter on the starboard inner engine, and this has been on and off for a while. I should have mentioned it to you before you went into the wing and see if you could have a look at this problem while you were in there”.  I put the overalls on again and I didn’t have to travel so far this time to find out what the problem was. The engines RPM’s were calculated by a flexible drive from the engine into a small generator, which was calculated to show on RPMs on the instrument panel in the cockpit. The electrical lead connecting to the generator was in bad condition and only hanging on by threads. I had to go back to where I entered the wing to ask the First Officer (who was standing where I was situated when I went out to the starboard engine), whether he had a match, preferably with a wooden stem. He replied jokingly through the roar of the engines “You are not going to fix the problem by setting fire to what you are working on, are you?” He got what I wanted and I crawled back to the generator. With the head of the match broken off I trimmed the lead the best I could and wedged it into the generator terminal with the match stem, and I soon got the signal from the First Officer that the Captain had given the OK.  This method of electrical transmission was the only way to transmit the RPMs in a multi engine aircraft where the engines are installed away from the cockpit.  When I got out of the wing again, the Skipper, First Officer and the Radio Officer all had a laugh about how to fix a problem with a match stem. The Captain said to me “you better go back downstairs right away, because lunch has been served and you will enjoy that after your work this morning”.  Almost straight after lunch I got another visit from the steward, who told me the Captain wanted to see me again. As soon as I saw him he said “you won’t believe it, but I am now having trouble with the port inner engine, and all the time I have been flying these boats, I have never had any problems with throttle controls until today, and I now have problems with two of the engines, plus RPM problems”.  By this time I had become used to slipping on the overalls and crawling in and out of the inside of the wing, and it didn’t take very long to correct the problem by following the same procedure as we did when adjustments were made on the starboard outer engine.   Accommodation at Darwin, where the passengers and crew were staying overnight, was nothing like what is available today. The temporary accommodation had no air-conditioning and even in June it was still humid, but Qantas had done their best to make things as good as possible. I have mentioned this because I was approached by the Qantas Station Officer, who told me that I might have to be taken off that flight and catch the next aircraft going out of Darwin. However, standing close by listening to this was the Captain who said, “You are not going to drop him off, because he is going with me”. My wife, who was travelling with me and at that time was 3 ½ months pregnant with our first child, and although in the early stages of pregnancy, she was naturally more pleased than me to keep going, and I was thankful for the Captain’s help.  I mentioned earlier that I, like most people never kept a diary of day-to-day life, or even travel experiences. However, in my case I rely on a good memory, assisted by my passports for exact dates of where I was at certain times and this information is very clear. It was for this reason, plus having timetables to give further confirmation of travelling times, I was able to trace back my movements of exactly where I was before the Qantas flight I was on, and when the maintenance took place while the aircraft was flying.  I had many flights while working for Imperial Airways and BOAC, and I never had any reason to remember the name of the Captain or any other member of the flight crew, and it was for that reason, the flight I refer to was no different to any other flights as far as the Captain’s name was concerned. As a matter of fact, the event was forgotten, like other interesting things that took place long ago, until I was having a discussion with Bruce Cowan, my old Smithy mate, while swapping some memorabilia of the years in between the time we worked apart for many years and a long way away from one another. As a result, some stories of what we both told one another were considered to be of interest considering the difference in what aviation is today and this story is an example of the past era. It was for that reason that I tried to see if I could get the name of the Captain I have referred to in this story.  I was hoping the exact dates with other information I had may help, when I asked George Roberts of Qantas if there were any Qantas captains still alive who were flying during the flying boat era, and hopefully contact the Captain, or a relative who may have had the log book of the flight.  George has had a very long association with Qantas, dating back to November 1936, and although he formally retired in 1970, after working for them for 34 years, he carried on doing valuable historical work, together with other colleagues. Although 93 years old when I last spoke to him and working 3 days a week on this valuable history of Qantas, his memory was still sharp and he was able to give me an immediate answer, “no Harry, there are no Qantas flying boat captains still alive today”. George was  awarded an OAM for his valuable historical work with Qantas, so there was no better person to go to at Qantas for information than George, so I will have to leave that pursuit there, and that’s a pity." title="" style="left:33px;top:277px;width:696px;height:2700px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 892.24px;">opened the fasteners holding the bulkhead panel, the pressure was more than I expected </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 911.23px;">and the bulkhead was hot. After the adjustments were carried out and the Captain was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 930.22px;">satisfied I had to get back, and this was not easy as there was no room to turn around, so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 949.21px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">I had to crawl backwards.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 987.02px;">When I got out of the wing the Captain thanked me and asked if I would like to sit in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1006.01px;">First Officer’s seat while he went downstairs to have a cup of tea or coffee. We had an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1025.01px;">interesting chat and after the First office returned I went back to my seat. I was not there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1044px;">long when I got another call to go back upstairs. The Captain said “I have been getting </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1062.99px;">fluctuations with the rev counter on the starboard inner engine, and this has been on and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1081.98px;">off for a while. I should have mentioned it to you before you went into the wing and see if </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1100.97px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">you could have a look at this problem while you were in there”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1138.78px;">I put the overalls on again and I didn’t have to travel so far this time to find out what the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1157.77px;">problem was. The engines RPM’s were calculated by a flexible drive from the engine into </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1176.77px;">a small generator, which was calculated to show on RPMs on the instrument panel in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1195.76px;">cockpit. The electrical lead connecting to the generator was in bad condition and only </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1214.75px;">hanging on by threads. I had to go back to where I entered the wing to ask the First Officer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1233.74px;">(who was standing where I was situated when I went out to the starboard engine), whether </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1252.73px;">he had a match, preferably with a wooden stem. He replied jokingly through the roar of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1271.72px;">engines “You are not going to fix the problem by setting fire to what you are working on, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1290.71px;">are you?” He got what I wanted and I crawled back to the generator. With the head of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1309.7px;">match broken off I trimmed the lead the best I could and wedged it into the generator </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1328.69px;">terminal with the match stem, and I soon got the signal from the First Officer that the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1347.68px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Captain had given the OK.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1385.5px;">This method of electrical transmission was the only way to transmit the RPMs in a multi </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1404.49px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">engine aircraft where the engines are installed away from the cockpit.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1442.3px;">When I got out of the wing again, the Skipper, First Officer and the Radio Officer all had a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1461.29px;">laugh about how to fix a problem with a match stem. The Captain said to me “you better </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1480.29px;">go back downstairs right away, because lunch has been served and you will enjoy that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1499.28px;">after your work this morning”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1537.09px;">Almost straight after lunch I got another visit from the steward, who told me the Captain </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1556.08px;">wanted to see me again. As soon as I saw him he said “you won’t believe it, but I am now </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1575.07px;">having trouble with the port inner engine, and all the time I have been flying these boats, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1594.06px;">have never had any problems with throttle controls until today, and I now have problems </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1613.05px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">with two of the engines, plus RPM problems”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1650.87px;">By this time I had become used to slipping on the overalls and crawling in and out of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1669.86px;">inside of the wing, and it didn’t take very long to correct the problem by following the same </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1688.85px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">procedure as we did when adjustments were made on the starboard outer engine.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1745.49px;">Accommodation at Darwin, where the passengers and crew were staying overnight, was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1764.48px;">nothing like what is available today. The temporary accommodation had no air-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1783.47px;">conditioning and even in June it was still humid, but Qantas had done their best to make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1802.47px;">things as good as possible. I have mentioned this because I was approached by the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1821.46px;">Qantas Station Officer, who told me that I might have to be taken off that flight and catch </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1840.45px;">the next aircraft going out of Darwin. However, standing close by listening to this was the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1859.44px;">Captain who said, “You are not going to drop him off, because he is going with me”. My </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1878.43px;">wife, who was travelling with me and at that time was 3 ½ months pregnant with our first </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1897.42px;">child, and although in the early stages of pregnancy, she was naturally more pleased than </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1916.41px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">me to keep going, and I was thankful for the Captain’s help.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1954.23px;">I mentioned earlier that I, like most people never kept a diary of day-to-day life, or even </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1973.22px;">travel experiences. However, in my case I rely on a good memory, assisted by my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1992.21px;">passports for exact dates of where I was at certain times and this information is very clear. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2011.2px;">It was for this reason, plus having timetables to give further confirmation of travelling </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2030.19px;">times, I was able to trace back my movements of exactly where I was before the Qantas </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2049.18px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">flight I was on, and when the maintenance took place while the aircraft was flying.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2086.99px;">I had many flights while working for Imperial Airways and BOAC, and I never had any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2105.99px;">reason to remember the name of the Captain or any other member of the flight crew, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2124.98px;">it was for that reason, the flight I refer to was no different to any other flights as far as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2143.97px;">Captain’s name was concerned. As a matter of fact, the event was forgotten, like other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2162.96px;">interesting things that took place long ago, until I was having a discussion with Bruce </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2181.95px;">Cowan, my old Smithy mate, while swapping some memorabilia of the years in between </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2200.94px;">the time we worked apart for many years and a long way away from one another. As a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2219.93px;">result, some stories of what we both told one another were considered to be of interest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2238.92px;">considering the difference in what aviation is today and this story is an example of the past </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2257.91px;">era. It was for that reason that I tried to see if I could get the name of the Captain I have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2276.9px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">referred to in this story.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2314.72px;">I was hoping the exact dates with other information I had may help, when I asked George </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2333.71px;">Roberts of Qantas if there were any Qantas captains still alive who were flying during the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2352.7px;">flying boat era, and hopefully contact the Captain, or a relative who may have had the log </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2371.69px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">book of the flight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2409.51px;">George has had a very long association with Qantas, dating back to November 1936, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2428.5px;">although he formally retired in 1970, after working for them for 34 years, he carried on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2447.49px;">doing valuable historical work, together with other colleagues. Although 93 years old when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2466.48px;">I last spoke to him and working 3 days a week on this valuable history of Qantas, his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2485.47px;">memory was still sharp and he was able to give me an immediate answer, “no Harry, there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2504.46px;">are no Qantas flying boat captains still alive today”. George was  awarded an OAM for his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2523.45px;">valuable historical work with Qantas, so there was no better person to go to at Qantas for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2542.44px;">information than George, so I will have to leave that pursuit there, and that’s a pity. </span>
