 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4642.png" alt="“Those Early Days” 1     Harry always planned to complete his novel on Early Aviation, but sadly time (and  molecular degeneration) caught up with him. When completed, it was to consist of two broad sections.  The first part was to be about Smithy and his achievements. This was not only to include Harry&#39;s experiences meeting him and working for him, but also to list Smithy’s achievements, and to correct any misinformation that had been published about him.  The second section was going to focus on Harry’s experiences after Smithy&#39;s passing. Here, Harry was going to focus on both the work &amp; cultural experiences he witnessed, in many exotic countries around the world.                            Here are sections Harry’s memoirs which he wrote himself, and were to be the start of “Those Were The Days”.   In August and September 1992 while on a tour of the U. K. and Europe I met another Tourist, an American by the name of Bill. While on such tours it was first name only. During a discussion with Bill he told me that he had worked in early Aviation a few years after the First World War and prior to that he had worked as a mechanic on some early cars, or ‘Autos’ as he described them.                               This was of course very interesting to me because I also worked in early aviation and  before that I served part of my early apprenticeship on Model T and Model A Ford cars,  and later on a range of Chrysler cars. I started work in 1928, which was a little later than  when Bill started. However, we both had some interesting things to talk about.   On one occasion I mentioned something I have often said to others to emphasise how  much progress has been made in aviation in the lifetime of those of my age. I was talking  about the time it took Imperial Airways to fly from London to Johannesburg in South Africa  in 11 days with 10 night stops. To continue to Cape Town it took another day making a  total time of 12 days with 11 night stops.                                             When I started work with Imperial Airways (a predecessor of British Airways) in 1936, the  timetable (which I still have) was the same as 1932 with two or three minor changes to  night stops, but the total time to Johannesburg and Cape Town was the same.                                       Listening to the discussion between Bill and I, was another person on the tour and she  said, &quot;that&#39;s ridiculous, why did it take so long&quot;? My first reaction left me stunned for a  few seconds and I then turned to her and said &quot;Maxine, were your children able to walk  and run from the time they were born&quot;? I don&#39;t know whether she got the message  because she said no more.   In between breaks in the two tours, my Brother-in-Law told me he would like to take me to  two Aviation Museums, knowing my interest in vintage aircraft. My visit to &quot;The  Shuttleworth Collection&quot; at Old Warden Aerodrome and Duxford which claims to be the  biggest and best aeroplane museum in Europe, showed the progress made over 54  years with two aircraft on display, which was of particular interest to me.  Shuttleworth had a 1915 Avro 504K aircraft, which was of special interest to me because  it was an Avro 504K that I had my first flight in an aeroplane, and I will have more to  mention about this marvellous old aircraft for it&#39;s age, later on.                                        Duxford had a Concorde on show and this sleek aircraft of Anglo/ French design created  a lot of interest worldwide when the two maiden flights took place. The French prototype  took flight on March 2, 1969 and the British prototype on April 9, 1969. Both aircraft  produced a cruising speed of Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound), in November 1970. Also of special interest to me was a flight made by British Airways in March 1985 when a  British Airways Concorde broke the London to Cape Town record, a distance of 9,650 km  in 8 hours and 8 minutes.   It was emphasised at that time that it clipped 3 hours off a Boeing 747 record in 1977  which was considered a great achievement. It took my memory back to when I worked at  most of the night stops and refuelling stops on that route. The same company then  operating as Imperial Airways had a schedule for London to Cape Town of 12 days with  11 night stops (as already mentioned).  The rate of progress since that time has left the majority of people today with no idea of  the early days of air transport, but what we have today would not have been possible  without the work of the early pioneers, who should not be forgotten. Maxine&#39;s comment  made me think that I should write a little book about my experiences in those early days,  and limit it to that era, because I believe that many people seem to forget, that everything  has a beginning.  However, an ignorant remark by an American Pilot, and two books published in the 90&#39;s  besmirched Sir Charles Kingsford Smith&#39;s character, and I feel compelled to add my  comment about this in my book, because these people should not be allowed to get away  with what they said. Kingsford Smith, affectionately known as ‘Smithy’ didn&#39;t deserve such  treatment after all he did for the development of aviation.    There were two letters in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1991 that referred to an American  Co-pilot who said, when announcing the impending arrival at Sydney Kingsford Smith  Airport that the airport was named after an Aussie aviator who flew across from New  Zealand in an old tri-motor. The ignorance of this person saying that, after all that Sir  Charles Kingsford Smith had done, requires more to be said about his achievements,  because there may be many others who are also completely ignorant of Smithy&#39;s  pioneering records. What I have to say about Smithy is not for the converted, but for  those who seem to know very little about this great aviation pioneer’s achievements.                                                                                                   I received a letter from Ian Mackersey dated 21 April 1992, advising me that he had been commissioned by his publisher in London to write a major new biography on the life of Smithy, and he was advised by Arch Steinbeck (who was then the Vice President of the Australian Early Birds of Australia and later President) that I might possibly be able to help him with some reminiscences of Smithy. This led to fourteen letters of correspondence between us.  During this time Scotty Allan&#39;s book &quot;Scotty Allan, Australia&#39;s Flying Scotsman&quot; was published and this resulted in more correspondence as I felt something had to be done to rectify the awful untruths said about Smithy, by Scotty.  Following this Ian Mackersey had his book &quot;Smithy, The Life of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith&quot; was published  63 years after Smithy&#39;s death. This needs some comment about how he set out very late after Smithy&#39;s death to rely on unreliable people such as Scotty Allan, when he had good reason to doubt what Scotty had told him on so many of his opinions about Smithy.              In addition, Ian Mackersey knew that Scotty actually fabricated many things that did not have an atom of truth in his book. Scotty is now dead but what I have to say about him with regards to his book will be no more than what I wrote to Dick Smith, with copies to Scotty Allan (when he was alive) and Elizabeth Shearman (Scotty&#39;s biographer). All letters were sent to these people by registered mail.  Elizabeth Shearman said in the introduction of Scotty&#39;s book, &quot;Scotty&#39;s wife, Barbara, provided encouragement, good advice and many excellent cups of tea! She also had the good sense to send the manuscript to Dick Smith. Last but certainly not least, Dick Smith should be congratulated for his perspicacity and appreciation of &quot;a great aviation story. Without Dick&#39;s enthusiastic support, the book would not have got off the runway.&quot;  It was for this reason that I wrote to Dick Smith on the 15th July 1993 and I told him that  after reading &quot;Scotty Allan, Australia&#39;s Flying Scotsman&quot; I was amazed that things said by  Scotty were completely fabricated and I made reference to these. I was advised that  there were other Early Birds who also wrote to Dick about the disgusting made - up  stories Scotty had to say about Smithy with the intention to besmirch him.  I received a letter back from the Australian Geographic Pty Ltd, dated 30 July 1993, which  said:                                       &quot;Dick has asked me to thank you very much for your letter of 15 July.    Dick has asked me to say that he will await an answer from Scotty Allan and Elizabeth  Shearman at which point he will be able to resolve any discrepancies and have these  corrected and/or add in any other opinions. Thank you once again for writing to Dick”. Yours sincerely, Natalie Ranald, Assistant to Dick Smith.                                                            I heard no more from Dick, Scotty or Elizabeth Shearman.  However, I have more to say  about this further on in my book, which is very important that people should know the  truth about Scotty&#39;s book, in fairness to Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. Of course nothing  can be done to rectify what has been said by Scotty in the books that have been sold. I  made enquiries to the publishers long after I wrote to Dick Smith and nothing had been  done to withdraw any books that had not been sold at that time.                                                         There was another case I have to mention, where a messenger of a person who said what  is known as &quot;the oil transfer in mid air&quot; never took place, and in doing so this person also  besmirched P.G.Taylor&#39;s  character. P.G. was a very honourable man who won the  George Cross for outstanding bravery for what he did when the oil transfer took place.  This now adds four stories to my original intention of what I intended to write about, but all  must be told, because neither Smithy or P.G. deserved the outrageous comments that  some have said about these two great men.       Readers may wonder why someone at 89 had left it so late to write this book, which I had  in mind back in 1992. An ironical turn of events with regards to aerodromes upset the  retirement plans of my wife and I, at the wrong time in our lives. Our case was a front line  story together with our photos in a leading local paper which emphasised the problems  residents had with properties under the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF),  relating to the proposed Airport at Badgery’s Creek outside of Sydney. This had a  devastating affect on people who had to sell their property because of age or sickness,  and who had purchased their land long before it was decided to build the aerodrome at  Badgery’s Creek.  This applied to the very best of properties that previously were easy to sell, but due to  restrictions placed on properties under the ANEF contour it was a different story, and no  compensation applied to many properties, even under the low ANEF readings which had  the same restrictions placed on them in some cases.                                       Although this was not something in the original agenda of my book of what I had planned  to write about back in 1992, I believe it will not only explain the reason for the delay I had  in writing this book, but it will show the good and bad side of the advancement of aviation  and the price many have had to pay for what we have today. However, that&#39;s a different  episode in my life and I will leave that story for later on.   Domestic responsibilities and the loss of sight of my right eye due to molecular degeneration with an advanced cataract in my left eye, plus the beginning of molecular  degeneration in my right eye, resulted in having to switch my typing to a computer  and this slowed me up for a while. But I wish I had made the switch much earlier because  of the benefits that a computer can give. Raising the font size from 10 to 22 did the trick  as far as assisting my eyesight.   MY EARLY INTEREST IN AVIATION  Kingsford Smith, Charles Ulm as co-pilot, Jim Warner as navigator and Harry Lyon as   wireless operator, made the first successful Pacific flight, between 31st May and 9th June 1928. This was and still is considered the first of the two greatest pioneering flights ever made, considering the time that this took place. In both cases Kingsford Smith was involved.                                                                 However, it was not until Kingsford Smith, Ulm, Harold Litchfield as navigator, and Tom McWilliams as wireless operator, who made the first successful flight across the Tasman Sea from Richmond Aerodrome outside of Sydney to Wigram Aerodrome in Christchurch NZ, a distance of 1,624 miles (in 14 hours and 25 minutes) that I really became totally interested in aviation.  It was through Kingsford Smith and all his aviation achievements that lead me into a  career in aviation, like it did to many youth and young men in Australia and New Zealand  at that time. In my case, early aviation gave me the opportunity to work in many countries that I would never have been able to do, if I had been a  fare-paying passenger.   For that reason, apart from having a very great admiration for what Smithy achieved, I  owe him a lot for giving me the initial start in aviation, and that gave me the privilege to work in such an interesting period of aviation.   I can remember that first successful flight to NZ very well, although I was then only two weeks away from my 14th birthday. The publicity build up before the flight was  tremendous, and with this publicity was the speculation about the safety of the Tasman  attempt, especially as it was on the 10th of January (the same year that Hood and  Moncrieff disappeared after attempting the Tasman crossing). That was a very sad time in NZ because so much was expected of these two pilots and both were Reserve Officers in the Royal NZ Air Force. Hood was a World War 1 pilot with a wooden leg. Both were pilots with considerable experience, and they had a good aircraft for that era, a Ryan, very similar to the Ryan used by Lindbergh&#39;s &quot;Spirit of St.Louis&quot; on his Trans-Atlantic flight. They had a radio but neither Hood or Moncrieff were able to operate it, so it was designed to send out signals every 15 minutes that would advise radio stations that all was ok. These signals were received up to an estimated 200 miles from NZ, and two ships actually said that they had spotted the Ryan. About their estimated time of arrival in NZ, a violent storm in the Tasman sea was  reported and following an extensive search for the two airman, it had to finally be  concluded that they were lost, and their tragedy lingered on in NZ for a very long time.    TRANS PACIFIC CROSSING  On the 31st May, 1928, Kingsford Smith and his 4-man crew left Oakland, California, to attempt the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia. They took off from Barking Sands on Mana, Kauai (since the runway at Wheeler was not long enough). They headed for Suva, Fiji, 5,077 kilometres away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the most demanding portion of the journey, as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. The third leg was the shortest, 2,709 kilometres in 20 hours, and crossed the Australian coastline near Ballina, before turning north to fly 170 kilometres to Brisbane, where they landed at 10.50 a.m. on 9 June. The total flight distance was approximately 11,566 kilometres. Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 26,000 at Eagle Farm Airport, and was welcomed as a hero.  Here, I quote Smithy and on the lessons he learnt on their record breaking flight, “We had certainly learned a great deal, and the outstanding object lesson was the paramount importance of the ability to fly blind for long periods in bad weather, such as in rain, cloud and fog, to which I have made previous reference&quot;.  Smithy continued on, focussing on their Suva landing, “These long distance flights are not accomplished without a succession of trials and anxieties, and I now began to think about our landing ground. We had previously telegraphed to Suva, prior to leaving Oakland, for details of the Albert Park Sports Oval, which was the only spot where we could land. The maximum runway, however, was barely 1200ft, in addition to which there were some awkward telegraph wires and three trees at the north-west corner, which we had asked to be removed.”                                                 	 “We were now in a fairly light condition, but as we circled round Suva I anxiously looked out for the landing ground. After over 30 hours in the air I knew that I was not altogether as bright and sharp-witted as when we took off. The strain of the blind flying and the bombardment of the rainstorms had added to my fatigue, and further more, I had never seen the Albert Park ground before the landing.”  “As I came down I suddenly caught sight of a sudden drop of about 12ft, from the roadway  to the field, and we were coming along at 65 miles per hour. We touched the ground half  way up the field. In front of me was a sharp rise, clothed in trees and thick undergrowth.  I had to ground loop the plane and swing to the left as we came to a stop&quot;. It cleared a  tree by 4 feet. One man amongst the locals was an ex World War 1 pilot who gave a  Radio commentary of Smithy&#39;s approach into Albert Park, and he could see nothing but a  doomsday scenario of the situation as Smithy was in, after such a successful flight, over such a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean.   Smithy felt apologetic about the arrangements the locals had made and the inadequate Albert  Park. However, there appeared to be nowhere else within Suva, suitable for an aircraft the size of the Southern Cross to take off or land.  The next day, the first thing Smithy had to do was to look for a possible place for a take off  with the Southern Cross (which needed to be fully loaded with petrol for their last hop to Australia). Local pilots recommended four sites that might of been suitable. While Ulm, Lyon and Warner visited the three sites closest to Suva, Smithy went by the Governor&#39;s launch twenty miles from Suva to Naselei Beach. This turned out to be an excellent site, with very firm sand and according to Smithy, the best runway he had seen. The only problem was getting the petrol to the sight and this slowed matters up, and naturally Smithy and Ulm were anxious to get to Australia as soon as possible.                             After making arrangements for petrol to be sent to Naselei Beach, the next move for  Smithy was to fly the Southern Cross out of Albert Park. As it was light with fuel he got it out after a short run of 400 yards, although he had the 12ft rise ahead of him (just another example of Smithy&#39;s flying ability).  I would like to mention Smithy&#39;s words again when he said &quot;I should like to discuss our  Pacific flight and to review the lessons which it taught us&quot;. I have mentioned some of  those difficulties such as the way navigation had to be carried out, and the limits of the  Southern Cross to climb above bad weather and the strain on all the crew, who had to  carry out precisely what they had to do, over such long and strenuous times. This will  allow readers to know the restrictions of what those early airman had to contend with,   when Smithy and Ulm made the first Pacific flight (and all the other pioneering flights  made by Smithy).     FIRST NON STOP FLIGHT ACROSS AUSTRALIA  This was the next important step (and record breaking moment) for Smithy. They chose the RAAF base at Point Cook (approximately 20 miles outside of Melbourne) for the flight to Perth, because it had a better runway for the take-off than what was available at Sydney. This was important because they were carrying a load of 900 gallons of petrol.    This flight of 2090 miles gave both the Radio Operator and Navigator prior experience  before the Tasman flight. It was mainly over land and a safe way to get acquainted with  their equipment.    It must be remembered that the flight was between the 8th and 9th of August 1928, and  transport from any where on the Eastern side of Australia to the West, at that time or vice  versa was extremely slow. Although the Trans-Australian railways had, by then been  operating for a number of years, it still took days to travel from East to West and any  flying would have been in stages and by charter only. This being so, Smithy and Ulm&#39;s  achievement of crossing the Continent in less than a day (in a time of 23 hours and 25  minutes) was another successful flight for Smithy and Ulm, and this again gave them  further publicity for their ultimate objective of operating an airline (firstly within Australia).  Although Smithy said it would only be a canter after the Pacific flight, which no doubt was  true, the fact that the flight took less than 24 hours was a considerable achievement for  those days. As everyone knows, Australia is a large island continent covering a very large  area of land and sparsely populated. As a result, time and distance between populations  was and still is an important matter, something that relates back to when the First Fleet arrived in Australia and settlement started to spread out.    Distance and time was always a problem, and even today politicians from Western  Australia and the Northern Territory find it time consuming when they try to get back  home from Canberra for a short break, so one can imagine how important that first flight  across the continent, non stop was at that time, and the impression it made on people. It was obvious that the Prime Minister realised the importance of Smithy and Ulm&#39;s achievement, because distance and time taken, whether it is for people or merchandise, would always be an important factor in the development of Australia, something the Prime Minister was always very much aware of.  In regards to the flight itself, it was another case of having to fly through very bad weather. So, Smithy decided to climb to 9000 feet to avoid the heavy rain but this made matters worse, because as the rain froze, Smithy and Ulm were pelted with sharp particles of ice on their face. This was another case of flying in those days, when it was impossible to climb high enough to avoid bad weather.  When they eventually arrived at Perth, there was not many there to greet them which was very unusual after the Pacific flight, as wherever Smithy went there were crowds to greet  him. The lack of people on his arrival at Perth, was due to a simple error as a result of   giving the wrong arrival time. When giving the estimated arrival time at Perth, McWilliams   gave Melbourne time which they were keeping on the flight, and this was two hours  ahead of Perth. But many in Perth, saw the Southern Cross fly over the City and they soon  made for Maylands Aerodrome, and it wasn&#39;t very long before a large crowd arrived.  Smithy had many friends in Perth where he spent three years as a Pilot with West  Australian Airways, and the hospitality given him by friends and others was such that their  stay in Perth was longer than originally planned. In addition, Maylands Aerodrome was  soaked after a build up of heavy rain and there was no hope of taking off until things  improved. Eventually the ground dried up enough for a take off with limited fuel to get to  Tammin, 90 miles east of Perth. Although the ground there was a little better than  Maylands, he could only take on enough fuel to fly to Adelaide, and another large crowd  was there to receive him. On this trip, McWilliams set a radio record for the Southern  Cross by hearing Adelaide while they were 1350 miles away.                                            From there, Smithy flew direct to Sydney non-stop after flying across Australia, covering a  distance of 4390 miles. There was no doubt that this flight created a lot of interest in  what aviation could do for distance travel in Australia. In addition it gave both Litchfield  and McWilliams very valuable experience for the trip ahead to New Zealand.                                                                                                         IMPORTANCE OF THE TRANS TRANSMAN CROSSING                                                                          It was obvious that the experience of the initial flight to New Zealand was twofold. Smithy  and Charles Ulm required certain information before they could safely embark on the  Tasman flight, but they also wanted the Governments of both countries to get involved. Because ultimately it was an airline that they were aiming for. This airline would give faster mail delivery and quicker transportation to the people between the two countries.    The  correspondence before and after this flight,with the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand emphasise the importance of the Tasman flight (bearing in mind that was in 1928). The careful planning and the detail of this flight was not an isolated case. All  Smithy&#39;s pioneering flights while with, and greatly assisted by Charles Ulm&#39;s organising  ability, and later (after Smithy and Ulm parted company), when he flew with other crews  and while flying solo, had the same thoroughness in planning applied. He was not the reckless type that some have tried to portray. He was a man with a genuine desire to pioneer flights in many parts of the world, that had not previously been crossed by air.  Smithy’s ultimate objective was proving what could be done in aviation, and to actively operate an airline, firstly within Australia and then an Airline across the Tasman and the Pacific. However, that was not to be his reward for all he had done. He was up against vested interest who could see his achievements as a threat to some existing airlines such as Imperial Airways, who had  planned to expand further over what was then the British Empire.    Shipping lines such as the Union Steamship Company ,who already had the majority of  the shipping business across the Tasman Sea, could also see aviation as a threat and  therefore they wanted to be prepared for at least a share in any aviation service across  the Tasman. When Tasman Airways (a predecessor of Air New Zealand) was first  established, the Union Steamship Company used their muscle and became a partner in  Tasman Airways.   In preparation for the crossing, The Prime Minister of Australia&#39;s Cablegram to the Prime Minister of New Zealand dated the 10th July 1928 lays out the detail that he received from his department of Defence. This followed a prompt reply by cablegram from the New Zealand Prime Minister dated the 13th July 1928 and the Prime Minister of Australia&#39;s reply dated the 14th July 1928. These emphasise the part and the interest the Prime Ministers of both countries had in the success of the Tasman flight. All cablegrams were confirmed by letters. This now gave the go ahead to prepare for the Tasman flight.                                  Continued on..." title="" style="left:41px;top:282px;width:1105px;height:9206px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 142.41px;">Harry always planned to complete his novel on Early Aviation, but sadly time (and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 161.4px;">molecular degeneration) caught up with him. When completed, it was to consist of</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 180.39px;">two broad sections.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 218.37px;">The first part was to be about Smithy and his achievements. This was not only to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 237.36px;">include Harry's experiences meeting him and working for him, but also to list Smithy’s</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 256.35px;">achievements, and to correct any misinformation that had been published about him.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 294.33px;">The second section was going to focus on Harry’s experiences after Smithy's passing.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 313.32px;">Here, Harry was going to focus on both the work &amp; cultural experiences he witnessed,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 332.31px;">in many exotic countries around the world.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 864.05px;">Here are sections Harry’s memoirs which he wrote himself, and were to be the start</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 883.04px;">of “Those Were The Days”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 940.01px;">In August and September 1992 while on a tour of the U. K. and Europe I met another</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 959px;">Tourist, an American by the name of Bill. While on such tours it was first name only.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 977.99px;">During a discussion with Bill he told me that he had worked in early Aviation a few years</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 996.99px;">after the First World War and prior to that he had worked as a mechanic on some</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1015.98px;">early cars, or ‘Autos’ as he described them.                             </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1053.96px;">This was of course very interesting to me because I also worked in early aviation and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1072.95px;">before that I served part of my early apprenticeship on Model T and Model A Ford cars, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1091.94px;">and later on a range of Chrysler cars. I started work in 1928, which was a little later than </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1110.93px;">when Bill started. However, we both had some interesting things to talk about. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1148.91px;">On one occasion I mentioned something I have often said to others to emphasise how </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1167.9px;">much progress has been made in aviation in the lifetime of those of my age. I was talking </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1186.89px;">about the time it took Imperial Airways to fly from London to Johannesburg in South Africa </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1205.88px;">in 11 days with 10 night stops. To continue to Cape Town it took another day making a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1224.87px;">total time of 12 days with 11 night stops.        </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1243.86px;">                                   </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1262.85px;">When I started work with Imperial Airways (a predecessor of British Airways) in 1936, the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1281.85px;">timetable (which I still have) was the same as 1932 with two or three minor changes to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1300.84px;">night stops, but the total time to Johannesburg and Cape Town was the same.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1319.83px;">                                     </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1338.82px;">Listening to the discussion between Bill and I, was another person on the tour and she </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1357.81px;">said, "that's ridiculous, why did it take so long"? My first reaction left me stunned for a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1376.8px;">few seconds and I then turned to her and said "Maxine, were your children able to walk </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1395.79px;">and run from the time they were born"? I don't know whether she got the message </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1414.78px;">because she said no more. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1452.76px;">In between breaks in the two tours, my Brother-in-Law told me he would like to take me to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1471.75px;">two Aviation Museums, knowing my interest in vintage aircraft. My visit to "The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1490.74px;">Shuttleworth Collection" at Old Warden Aerodrome and Duxford which claims to be the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1509.73px;">biggest and best aeroplane museum in Europe, showed the progress made over 54 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1528.72px;">years with two aircraft on display, which was of particular interest to me.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1566.71px;">Shuttleworth had a 1915 Avro 504K aircraft, which was of special interest to me because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1585.7px;">it was an Avro 504K that I had my first flight in an aeroplane, and I will have more to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1604.69px;">mention about this marvellous old aircraft for it's age, later on.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1623.68px;">                        </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1908.54px;">Duxford had a Concorde on show and this sleek aircraft of Anglo/ French design created </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1927.53px;">a lot of interest worldwide when the two maiden flights took place. The French prototype </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1946.52px;">took flight on March 2, 1969 and the British prototype on April 9, 1969. Both aircraft </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1965.51px;">produced a cruising speed of Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound), in November 1970.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1984.5px;">Also of special interest to me was a flight made by British Airways in March 1985 when a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2003.49px;">British Airways Concorde broke the London to Cape Town record, a distance of 9,650 km </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2022.48px;">in 8 hours and 8 minutes. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2060.46px;">It was emphasised at that time that it clipped 3 hours off a Boeing 747 record in 1977 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2079.45px;">which was considered a great achievement. It took my memory back to when I worked at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2098.44px;">most of the night stops and refuelling stops on that route. The same company then </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2117.43px;">operating as Imperial Airways had a schedule for London to Cape Town of 12 days with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2136.43px;">11 night stops (as already mentioned).</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2174.41px;">The rate of progress since that time has left the majority of people today with no idea of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2193.4px;">the early days of air transport, but what we have today would not have been possible </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2212.39px;">without the work of the early pioneers, who should not be forgotten. Maxine's comment </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2231.38px;">made me think that I should write a little book about my experiences in those early days, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2250.37px;">and limit it to that era, because I believe that many people seem to forget, that everything </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2269.36px;">has a beginning.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2307.34px;">However, an ignorant remark by an American Pilot, and two books published in the 90's </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2326.33px;">besmirched Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's character, and I feel compelled to add my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2345.32px;">comment about this in my book, because these people should not be allowed to get away </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2364.31px;">with what they said. Kingsford Smith, affectionately known as ‘Smithy’ didn't deserve such </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2383.3px;">treatment after all he did for the development of aviation.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2402.29px;">  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2421.29px;">There were two letters in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1991 that referred to an American </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2440.28px;">Co-pilot who said, when announcing the impending arrival at Sydney Kingsford Smith </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2459.27px;">Airport that the airport was named after an Aussie aviator who flew across from New </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2478.26px;">Zealand in an old tri-motor. The ignorance of this person saying that, after all that Sir </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2497.25px;">Charles Kingsford Smith had done, requires more to be said about his achievements, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2516.24px;">because there may be many others who are also completely ignorant of Smithy's </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2535.23px;">pioneering records. What I have to say about Smithy is not for the converted, but for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2554.22px;">those who seem to know very little about this great aviation pioneer’s achievements.                                                                                                 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2592.2px;">I received a letter from Ian Mackersey dated 21 April 1992,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2611.19px;">advising me that he had been commissioned by his</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2630.18px;">publisher in London to write a major new biography on the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2649.17px;">life of Smithy, and he was advised by Arch Steinbeck</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2668.16px;">(who was then the Vice President of the Australian Early</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2687.15px;">Birds of Australia and later President) that I might possibly</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2706.15px;">be able to help him with some reminiscences of Smithy.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2725.14px;">This led to fourteen letters of correspondence between us.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2763.12px;">During this time Scotty Allan's book "Scotty Allan, Australia's</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2782.11px;">Flying Scotsman" was published and this resulted in more</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2801.1px;">correspondence as I felt something had to be done to rectify</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2820.09px;">the awful untruths said about Smithy, by Scotty.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2858.07px;">Following this Ian Mackersey had his book "Smithy, The Life</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2877.06px;">of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith" was published  63 years after</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2896.05px;">Smithy's death. This needs some comment about how he set</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2915.04px;">out very late after Smithy's death to rely on unreliable people</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2934.03px;">such as Scotty Allan, when he had good reason to doubt what</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2953.02px;">Scotty had told him on so many of his opinions about Smithy.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2972.01px;">            </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2991.01px;">In addition, Ian Mackersey knew that Scotty actually</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3010px;">fabricated many things that did not have an atom of truth</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3028.99px;">in his book. Scotty is now dead but what I have to say about</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3047.98px;">him with regards to his book will be no more than what I</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3066.97px;">wrote to Dick Smith, with copies to Scotty Allan (when he was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3085.96px;">alive) and Elizabeth Shearman (Scotty's biographer). All</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3104.95px;">letters were sent to these people by registered mail.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3142.93px;">Elizabeth Shearman said in the introduction of Scotty's book,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3161.92px;">"Scotty's wife, Barbara, provided encouragement, good</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3180.91px;">advice and many excellent cups of tea! She also had the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3199.9px;">good sense to send the manuscript to Dick Smith. Last but</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3218.89px;">certainly not least, Dick Smith should be congratulated for his perspicacity and</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3237.88px;">appreciation of "a great aviation story. Without Dick's enthusiastic support, the book would</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3256.87px;">not have got off the runway."</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3294.86px;">It was for this reason that I wrote to Dick Smith on the 15th July 1993 and I told him that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3313.85px;">after reading "Scotty Allan, Australia's Flying Scotsman" I was amazed that things said by </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3332.84px;">Scotty were completely fabricated and I made reference to these. I was advised that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3351.83px;">there were other Early Birds who also wrote to Dick about the disgusting made - up </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3370.82px;">stories Scotty had to say about Smithy with the intention to besmirch him.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3408.8px;">I received a letter back from the Australian Geographic Pty Ltd, dated 30 July 1993, which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3427.79px;">said:      </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3446.78px;">                               </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3465.77px;">"Dick has asked me to thank you very much for your letter of 15 July.   </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3484.76px;">Dick has asked me to say that he will await an answer from Scotty Allan and Elizabeth </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3503.75px;">Shearman at which point he will be able to resolve any discrepancies and have these </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3522.74px;">corrected and/or add in any other opinions. Thank you once again for writing to Dick”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3541.73px;">Yours sincerely,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3560.73px;">Natalie Ranald, Assistant to Dick Smith.     </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3579.72px;">                                                    </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3617.7px;">I heard no more from Dick, Scotty or Elizabeth Shearman.  However, I have more to say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3636.69px;">about this further on in my book, which is very important that people should know the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3655.68px;">truth about Scotty's book, in fairness to Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. Of course nothing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3674.67px;">can be done to rectify what has been said by Scotty in the books that have been sold. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3693.66px;">made enquiries to the publishers long after I wrote to Dick Smith and nothing had been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3712.65px;">done to withdraw any books that had not been sold at that time. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3731.64px;">                                                      </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3750.63px;">There was another case I have to mention, where a messenger of a person who said what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3769.62px;">is known as "the oil transfer in mid air" never took place, and in doing so this person also </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3788.61px;">besmirched P.G.Taylor's  character. P.G. was a very honourable man who won the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3807.6px;">George Cross for outstanding bravery for what he did when the oil transfer took place.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3845.59px;">This now adds four stories to my original intention of what I intended to write about, but all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3864.58px;">must be told, because neither Smithy or P.G. deserved the outrageous comments that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3883.57px;">some have said about these two great men.    </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3940.54px;">Readers may wonder why someone at 89 had left it so late to write this book, which I had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3959.53px;">in mind back in 1992. An ironical turn of events with regards to aerodromes upset the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3978.52px;">retirement plans of my wife and I, at the wrong time in our lives. Our case was a front line </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3997.51px;">story together with our photos in a leading local paper which emphasised the problems </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4016.5px;">residents had with properties under the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF), </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4035.49px;">relating to the proposed Airport at Badgery’s Creek outside of Sydney. This had a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4054.48px;">devastating affect on people who had to sell their property because of age or sickness, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4073.47px;">and who had purchased their land long before it was decided to build the aerodrome at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4092.46px;">Badgery’s Creek.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4130.45px;">This applied to the very best of properties that previously were easy to sell, but due to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4149.44px;">restrictions placed on properties under the ANEF contour it was a different story, and no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4168.43px;">compensation applied to many properties, even under the low ANEF readings which had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4187.42px;">the same restrictions placed on them in some cases.    </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4206.41px;">                                 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4225.4px;">Although this was not something in the original agenda of my book of what I had planned </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4244.39px;">to write about back in 1992, I believe it will not only explain the reason for the delay I had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4263.38px;">in writing this book, but it will show the good and bad side of the advancement of aviation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4282.37px;">and the price many have had to pay for what we have today. However, that's a different </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4301.36px;">episode in my life and I will leave that story for later on. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4339.34px;">Domestic responsibilities and the loss of sight of my right eye due to molecular</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4358.33px;">degeneration with an advanced cataract in my left eye, plus the beginning of molecular </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4377.32px;">degeneration in my right eye, resulted in having to switch my typing to a computer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4396.31px;">and this slowed me up for a while. But I wish I had made the switch much earlier because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4415.31px;">of the benefits that a computer can give. Raising the font size from 10 to 22 did the trick </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4434.3px;">as far as assisting my eyesight.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s21 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4491.27px;"><span class="xr_s22 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">MY EARLY INTEREST IN AVIATION</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4531.48px;">Kingsford Smith, Charles Ulm as co-pilot,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4550.47px;">Jim Warner as navigator and Harry Lyon as  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4569.47px;">wireless operator, made the first successful</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4588.46px;">Pacific flight, between 31st May and 9th June</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4607.45px;">1928. This was and still is considered the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4626.44px;">first of the two greatest pioneering flights</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4645.43px;">ever made, considering the time that this</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4664.42px;">took place. In both cases Kingsford Smith</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4683.41px;">was involved.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4702.4px;">                                                               </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4721.39px;">However, it was not until Kingsford Smith,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4740.38px;">Ulm, Harold Litchfield as navigator, and Tom</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4759.37px;">McWilliams as wireless operator, who made the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4778.36px;">first successful flight across the Tasman Sea</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4797.35px;">from Richmond Aerodrome outside of Sydney to Wigram Aerodrome in Christchurch</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4816.34px;">NZ, a distance of 1,624 miles (in 14 hours and 25 minutes) that I really became totally</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4835.33px;">interested in aviation.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4873.32px;">It was through Kingsford Smith and all his aviation achievements that lead me into a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4892.31px;">career in aviation, like it did to many youth and young men in Australia and New Zealand </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4911.3px;">at that time. In my case, early aviation gave me the opportunity to work in many countries</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4930.29px;">that I would never have been able to do, if I had been a  fare-paying passenger.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4949.28px;">For that reason, apart from having a very great admiration for what Smithy achieved, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4968.27px;">owe him a lot for giving me the initial start in aviation, and that gave me the privilege to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4987.26px;">work in such an interesting period of aviation. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5025.24px;">I can remember that first successful flight</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5044.23px;">to NZ very well, although I was then only</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5063.22px;">two weeks away from my 14th birthday.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5082.21px;">The publicity build up before the flight was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5101.2px;">tremendous, and with this publicity was the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5120.19px;">speculation about the safety of the Tasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5139.19px;">attempt, especially as it was on the 10th</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5158.18px;">of January (the same year that Hood and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5177.17px;">Moncrieff disappeared after attempting the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5196.16px;">Tasman crossing). That was a very sad</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5215.15px;">time in NZ because so much was expected</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5234.14px;">of these two pilots and both were Reserve</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5253.13px;">Officers in the Royal NZ Air Force. Hood</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5272.12px;">was a World War 1 pilot with a wooden</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5291.11px;">leg. Both were pilots with considerable</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5310.1px;">experience, and they had a good aircraft for that era, a Ryan, very similar to the Ryan used</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5329.09px;">by Lindbergh's "Spirit of St.Louis" on his Trans-Atlantic flight. They had a radio but neither</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5348.08px;">Hood or Moncrieff were able to operate it, so it was designed to send out signals every</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5367.07px;">15 minutes that would advise radio stations that all was ok. These signals were received</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5386.06px;">up to an estimated 200 miles from NZ, and two ships actually said that they had spotted the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5405.05px;">Ryan. About their estimated time of arrival in NZ, a violent storm in the Tasman sea was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5424.05px;">reported and following an extensive search for the two airman, it had to finally be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5443.04px;">concluded that they were lost, and their tragedy lingered on in NZ for a very long time.</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5555.86px;">On the 31st May, 1928, Kingsford Smith and his 4-man crew left Oakland, California, to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5574.85px;">attempt the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia. They took off from Barking Sands on Mana,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5593.84px;">Kauai (since the runway at Wheeler was not long enough). They headed for Suva, Fiji,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5612.83px;">5,077 kilometres away, taking 34 hours 30 minutes. This was the most demanding portion</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5631.83px;">of the journey, as they flew through a massive lightning storm near the equator. The third</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5650.82px;">leg was the shortest, 2,709 kilometres in 20 hours, and crossed the Australian coastline</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5669.81px;">near Ballina, before turning north to fly 170 kilometres to Brisbane, where they landed at</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5688.8px;">10.50 a.m. on 9 June. The total flight distance was approximately 11,566 kilometres.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5707.79px;">Kingsford Smith was met by a huge crowd of 26,000 at Eagle Farm Airport, and was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5726.78px;">welcomed as a hero.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5764.76px;">Here, I quote Smithy and on the lessons he learnt on their record breaking flight, “We</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5783.75px;">had certainly learned a great deal, and the outstanding object lesson was the paramount</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5802.74px;">importance of the ability to fly blind for long periods in bad weather, such as in rain, cloud</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5821.73px;">and fog, to which I have made previous reference".</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5859.71px;">Smithy continued on, focussing on their Suva landing,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5878.7px;">“These long distance flights are not accomplished</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5897.69px;">without a succession of trials and anxieties, and I now</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5916.69px;">began to think about our landing ground. We had</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5935.68px;">previously telegraphed to Suva, prior to leaving Oakland,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5954.67px;">for details of the Albert Park Sports Oval, which was the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5973.66px;">only spot where we could land. The maximum runway,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 5992.65px;">however, was barely 1200ft, in addition to which there</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6011.64px;">were some awkward telegraph wires and three trees</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6030.63px;">at the north-west corner, which we had asked to be</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6049.62px;">removed.”</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6068.61px;">                                                </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6087.6px;">“We were now in a fairly light condition, but as we circled</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6106.59px;">round Suva I anxiously looked out for the landing</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6125.58px;">ground. After over 30 hours in the air I knew that I was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6144.57px;">not altogether as bright and sharp-witted as when we</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6163.56px;">took off. The strain of the blind flying and the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6182.55px;">bombardment of the rainstorms had added to my</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6201.55px;">fatigue, and further more, I had never seen the Albert</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 264.57px; top: 6220.54px;">Park ground before the landing.”</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6258.52px;">“As I came down I suddenly caught sight of a sudden drop of about 12ft, from the roadway </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6277.51px;">to the field, and we were coming along at 65 miles per hour. We touched the ground half </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6296.5px;">way up the field. In front of me was a sharp rise, clothed in trees and thick undergrowth. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6315.49px;">I had to ground loop the plane and swing to the left as we came to a stop". It cleared a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6334.48px;">tree by 4 feet. One man amongst the locals was an ex World War 1 pilot who gave a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6353.47px;">Radio commentary of Smithy's approach into Albert Park, and he could see nothing but a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6372.46px;">doomsday scenario of the situation as Smithy was in, after such a successful flight, over</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6391.45px;">such a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6429.43px;">Smithy felt apologetic about the arrangements the locals had made and the inadequate</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6448.42px;">Albert  Park. However, there appeared to be nowhere else within Suva, suitable for an</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6467.41px;">aircraft the size of the Southern Cross to take off or land.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6505.4px;">The next day, the first thing Smithy had to do was to look for a possible place for a take off </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6524.39px;">with the Southern Cross (which needed to be fully loaded with petrol for their last hop to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6543.38px;">Australia). Local pilots recommended four sites that might of been suitable. While Ulm, Lyon</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6562.37px;">and Warner visited the three sites closest to Suva, Smithy went by the Governor's launch</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6581.36px;">twenty miles from Suva to Naselei Beach. This turned out to be an excellent site, with very</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6600.35px;">firm sand and according to Smithy, the best runway he had seen. The only problem was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6619.34px;">getting the petrol to the sight and this slowed matters up, and naturally Smithy and Ulm</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6638.33px;">were anxious to get to Australia as soon as possible.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6657.32px;">                           </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6676.31px;">After making arrangements for petrol to be sent to Naselei Beach, the next move for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6695.3px;">Smithy was to fly the Southern Cross out of Albert Park. As it was light with fuel he got it</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6714.29px;">out after a short run of 400 yards, although he had the 12ft rise ahead of him (just another</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6733.28px;">example of Smithy's flying ability).</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6771.27px;">I would like to mention Smithy's words again when he said "I should like to discuss our </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6790.26px;">Pacific flight and to review the lessons which it taught us". I have mentioned some of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6809.25px;">those difficulties such as the way navigation had to be carried out, and the limits of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6828.24px;">Southern Cross to climb above bad weather and the strain on all the crew, who had to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6847.23px;">carry out precisely what they had to do, over such long and strenuous times. This will </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6866.22px;">allow readers to know the restrictions of what those early airman had to contend with,  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6885.21px;">when Smithy and Ulm made the first Pacific flight (and all the other pioneering flights </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6904.2px;">made by Smithy). </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s21 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6980.16px;"><span class="xr_s22 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">FIRST NON STOP FLIGHT ACROSS AUSTRALIA</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7020.38px;">This was the next important step (and record breaking moment) for Smithy. They chose</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7039.37px;">the RAAF base at Point Cook (approximately 20 miles outside of Melbourne) for the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7058.36px;">flight to Perth, because it had a better runway for the take-off than what was available at</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7077.35px;">Sydney. This was important because they were carrying a load of 900 gallons of petrol.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7115.33px;">This flight of 2090 miles gave both the Radio Operator and Navigator prior experience </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7134.32px;">before the Tasman flight. It was mainly over land and a safe way to get acquainted with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7153.31px;">their equipment.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7191.29px;">It must be remembered that the flight was between the 8th and 9th of August 1928, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7210.29px;">transport from any where on the Eastern side of Australia to the West, at that time or vice </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7229.28px;">versa was extremely slow. Although the Trans-Australian railways had, by then been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7248.27px;">operating for a number of years, it still took days to travel from East to West and any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7267.26px;">flying would have been in stages and by charter only. This being so, Smithy and Ulm's </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7286.25px;">achievement of crossing the Continent in less than a day (in a time of 23 hours and 25 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7305.24px;">minutes) was another successful flight for Smithy and Ulm, and this again gave them </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7324.23px;">further publicity for their ultimate objective of operating an airline (firstly within Australia).</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7362.21px;">Although Smithy said it would only be a canter after the Pacific flight, which no doubt was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7381.2px;">true, the fact that the flight took less than 24 hours was a considerable achievement for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7400.19px;">those days. As everyone knows, Australia is a large island continent covering a very large </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7419.18px;">area of land and sparsely populated. As a result, time and distance between populations </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7438.17px;">was and still is an important matter, something that relates back to when the First Fleet</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7457.16px;">arrived in Australia and settlement started to spread out.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7495.15px;">Distance and time was always a problem, and even today politicians from Western </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7514.14px;">Australia and the Northern Territory find it time consuming when they try to get back </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7533.13px;">home from Canberra for a short break, so one can imagine how important that first flight </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7552.12px;">across the continent, non stop was at that time, and the impression it made on people. It</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7571.11px;">was obvious that the Prime Minister realised the importance of Smithy and Ulm's</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7590.1px;">achievement, because distance and time taken, whether it is for people or merchandise,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7609.09px;">would always be an important factor in the development of Australia, something the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7628.08px;">Prime Minister was always very much aware of.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7666.06px;">In regards to the flight itself, it was another case of having to fly through very bad weather.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7685.05px;">So, Smithy decided to climb to 9000 feet to avoid the heavy rain but this made matters</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7704.04px;">worse, because as the rain froze, Smithy and Ulm were pelted with sharp particles of ice on</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7723.03px;">their face. This was another case of flying in those days, when it was impossible to climb</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7742.02px;">high enough to avoid bad weather.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7780.01px;">When they eventually arrived at Perth, there was not many there to greet them which was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7799px;">very unusual after the Pacific flight, as wherever Smithy went there were crowds to greet </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7817.99px;">him. The lack of people on his arrival at Perth, was due to a simple error as a result of  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7836.98px;">giving the wrong arrival time. When giving the estimated arrival time at Perth, McWilliams  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7855.97px;">gave Melbourne time which they were keeping on the flight, and this was two hours </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7874.96px;">ahead of Perth. But many in Perth, saw the Southern Cross fly over the City and they soon </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7893.95px;">made for Maylands Aerodrome, and it wasn't very long before a large crowd arrived.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7931.93px;">Smithy had many friends in Perth where he spent three years as a Pilot with West </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7950.92px;">Australian Airways, and the hospitality given him by friends and others was such that their </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7969.91px;">stay in Perth was longer than originally planned. In addition, Maylands Aerodrome was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7988.9px;">soaked after a build up of heavy rain and there was no hope of taking off until things </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8007.89px;">improved. Eventually the ground dried up enough for a take off with limited fuel to get to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8026.88px;">Tammin, 90 miles east of Perth. Although the ground there was a little better than </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8045.87px;">Maylands, he could only take on enough fuel to fly to Adelaide, and another large crowd </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8064.87px;">was there to receive him. On this trip, McWilliams set a radio record for the Southern </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8083.86px;">Cross by hearing Adelaide while they were 1350 miles away.                                          </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8121.84px;">From there, Smithy flew direct to Sydney non-stop after flying across Australia, covering a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8140.83px;">distance of 4390 miles. There was no doubt that this flight created a lot of interest in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8159.82px;">what aviation could do for distance travel in Australia. In addition it gave both Litchfield </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8178.81px;">and McWilliams very valuable experience for the trip ahead to New Zealand.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8197.8px;">                                                             </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8235.78px;">                                        </span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8291.64px;">It was obvious that the experience of the initial flight to New Zealand was twofold. Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8310.63px;">and Charles Ulm required certain information before they could safely embark on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8329.62px;">Tasman flight, but they also wanted the Governments of both countries to get involved.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8348.61px;">Because ultimately it was an airline that they were aiming for. This airline would give</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8367.6px;">faster mail delivery and quicker transportation to the people between the two countries.  </span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8462.55px;">of the Tasman flight (bearing in mind that was</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8500.53px;">of this flight was not an isolated case. All </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8519.52px;">Smithy's pioneering flights while with, and</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8538.51px;">greatly assisted by Charles Ulm's organising </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8557.51px;">ability, and later (after Smithy and Ulm parted</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8576.5px;">company), when he flew with other crews </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8595.49px;">and while flying solo, had the same</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8614.48px;">thoroughness in planning applied. He was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8633.47px;">not the reckless type that some have tried to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8652.46px;">portray. He was a man with a genuine desire</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8671.45px;">to pioneer flights in many parts of the world,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8690.44px;">that had not previously been crossed by air.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8728.42px;">Smithy’s ultimate objective was proving</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8747.41px;">what could be done in aviation, and to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8766.4px;">actively operate an airline, firstly within</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8785.39px;">Australia and then an Airline across the</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8804.38px;">Tasman and the Pacific. However, that</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8823.37px;">was not to be his reward for all he had done. He was up against vested interest who</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8842.37px;">could see his achievements as a threat to some existing airlines such as Imperial Airways,</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8861.36px;">who had  planned to expand further over what was then the British Empire.  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8899.34px;">Shipping lines such as the Union Steamship Company ,who already had the majority of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8918.33px;">the shipping business across the Tasman Sea, could also see aviation as a threat and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8937.32px;">therefore they wanted to be prepared for at least a share in any aviation service across </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8956.31px;">the Tasman. When Tasman Airways (a predecessor of Air New Zealand) was first </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8975.3px;">established, the Union Steamship Company used their muscle and became a partner in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 8994.29px;">Tasman Airways. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9032.27px;">In preparation for the crossing, The Prime Minister of Australia's Cablegram to the Prime</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9051.26px;">Minister of New Zealand dated the 10th July 1928 lays out the detail that he received from</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9070.25px;">his department of Defence. This followed a prompt reply by cablegram from the New</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9089.24px;">Zealand Prime Minister dated the 13th July 1928 and the Prime Minister of Australia's reply</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9108.23px;">dated the 14th July 1928. These emphasise the part and the interest the Prime Ministers</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9127.22px;">of both countries had in the success of the Tasman flight. All cablegrams were confirmed by</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 9146.22px;">letters. This now gave the go ahead to prepare for the Tasman flight.</span>
