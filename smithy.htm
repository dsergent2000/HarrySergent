 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/6318.png" alt="“Smithy”   To understand Harry’s early fascination in aviation, it is important to explain the background of what a lot of people consider the world&#39;s greatest aviator - Sir Charles Kingsford Smith.  When Harry was growing up in New Zealand, ‘Smithy’ was a hero, and the stories of his record breaking flights were legendary. Apart from setting amazing records, he was redefining flights paths, and surpassing all expectations of what people thought were possible.  At 19 years old, news of Smithy returning to New Zealand, was overwhelming for Harry. It motivated Harry heading on a quest around vast areas of New Zealand, following Smithy’s path.  This would later lead to Harry meeting Smithy and his team, and ultimately being awarded a job as Smithy’s Ground staff / Engineer at Mascot.    The below article on Smithy is provided to detail the amazing person Smithy was, and to remind us how it motivated Harry:    It has been sourced from:   www.abc.net.au/schoolstv/australians/cksmith.htm   Charles Kingsford-Smith has been called the world&#39;s greatest aviator. His record breaking flights and almost superhuman flying skills are legendary.  Charles Edward Kingsford-Smith was born in Brisbane in 1897, the youngest of seven children. Charles, or &#39;Chilla&#39; as he was nicknamed was a small, energetic boy who loved adventure and would do anything for a dare.  He also loved working with his hands. At the age of 13 he began studying mechanics and electrical engineering at Sydney Technical College. He was a good but not brilliant student and got bored easily. He much preferred to be riding his motor bike. World War 1 burst over Europe and Charles enlisted on his 18th birthday. He couldn&#39;t wait to see some action. After fighting at Gallipoli, and a stint as a motor-bike despatch rider, he was chosen to join Britain&#39;s Royal Flying Corps which urgently needed pilots.  It was 1916 and aeroplanes were new inventions. The planes &#39;Smithy&#39; learnt to fly were made of fabric, wire and timber. It was something he loved from the very first moment. He wrote home to his parents, &quot;I have discovered one thing about flying and that is that my future, for whatever it may be worth, is bound up with it.&quot;  Oh, he was made for flying. They say of some aviators, they were born to fly, well &#39;Smithy&#39; was born to be obsessed by flying. In one of his many flying missions during the war his plane was riddled with bullets. &#39;Smithy&#39; was shot in the foot and later had three toes amputated. His war days were over.  He was presented with the Military Cross by King George and at only 20 years old was a war hero. He travelled to America and worked in Hollywood as a stunt pilot. It was a dangerous occupation and when another stuntman was killed he quit. On returning to Australia in 1921 he was broke.  Luckily the aviation industry in Australia was booming so &#39;Smithy&#39; joined the West Australian Airways flying mail through the outback. But what he really wanted, was to be the first to fly across the Pacific ocean. With borrowed and donated money he went to America, bought a plane and named it &#39;Southern Cross&#39;.  On May 31, 1928, &#39;Smithy&#39; with co-pilot Charles Ulm, navigator Harry Lyon and radio operator James Warner set off from San Francisco. The crossing was a three-legged marathon in a plane with an open cockpit.  The difficulties of a pioneering flight across a featureless ocean, the difficulties of navigation, the difficulties of the weight of the aircraft, the only thing was their eternal optimism. When they reached Brisbane, eighty three flying hours later they had completed the first air crossing of the Pacific. Three hundred thousand people welcomed them when they flew to Sydney.  Smithy didn&#39;t stop there. Aviators around the world were competing to be the first, the fastest, the best. &#39;Smithy&#39; continued to break and re- break records.    In 1930 at the age of 32 he flew 16,000 kilometres single handedly and won the England to Australia air race. Two weeks later he married Mary Powell and they were to have a son, Charles.  In 1933 after once again breaking the record for solo flight from England to Australia, he was acclaimed as the world&#39;s greatest airman. &#39;Smithy&#39; held more long distance flying records than anyone else on earth. But the adulation couldn&#39;t last forever.  Later when &#39;Smithy&#39; pulled out of a race because his plane wasn&#39;t ready, he was sent white feathers in the post. The sign of a coward. He was devastated. The press criticised him and his health suffered. It was the most difficult period in his life.  At 38 Smithy was a veteran but wanted to prove he still had what it took. So on November 6, 1935, &#39;Smithy&#39; and Tommy Pethybridge took off from England on what was to be his last record breaking attempt. A day later &#39;Smithy&#39;s&#39; plane disappeared near Burma. It has never been found.  Charles Kingsford-Smith pioneered more long distance routes than any pilot in history. He lived and died for flying. He was one of the really genuine achievers, an honest achiever, a pioneering achiever. A man who faced the odds and overcame them. If people think of him as a hero, then they have a good role model." title="" style="left:31px;top:265px;width:663px;height:2397px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1540.57px;">was their eternal optimism. When they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1559.56px;">reached Brisbane, eighty three flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1578.55px;">hours later they had completed the first </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1597.55px;">air crossing of the Pacific. Three hundred </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1616.54px;">thousand people welcomed them when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1635.53px;">they flew to Sydney.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1673.51px;">Smithy didn't stop there. Aviators around </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1692.5px;">the world were competing to be the first, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1711.49px;">the fastest, the best. 'Smithy' continued </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 337px; top: 1730.48px;">to break and re- break records.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1806.44px;">In 1930 at the age of 32 he flew 16,000 kilometres single handedly and won the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1825.43px;">England to Australia air race. Two weeks later he married Mary Powell and they were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1844.42px;">to have a son, Charles.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1882.41px;">In 1933 after once again breaking the record for solo flight from England to Australia, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1901.4px;">he was acclaimed as the world's greatest airman. 'Smithy' held more long distance </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1920.39px;">flying records than anyone else on earth. But the adulation couldn't last forever.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1958.37px;">Later when 'Smithy' pulled out of a race because his plane wasn't ready, he was sent </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1977.36px;">white feathers in the post. The sign of a coward. He was devastated. The press </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 1996.35px;">criticised him and his health suffered. It was the most difficult period in his life.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2034.33px;">At 38 Smithy was a veteran but wanted to prove he still had what it took. So on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2053.32px;">November 6, 1935, 'Smithy' and Tommy Pethybridge took off from England on what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2072.31px;">was to be his last record breaking attempt. A day later 'Smithy's' plane disappeared </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2091.3px;">near Burma. It has never been found.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2129.28px;">Charles Kingsford-Smith pioneered more long distance routes than any pilot in history. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2148.27px;">He lived and died for flying. He was one of the really genuine achievers, an honest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2167.27px;">achiever, a pioneering achiever. A man who faced the odds and overcame them. If </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2186.26px;">people think of him as a hero, then they have a good role model.</span>
