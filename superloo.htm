 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4925.png" alt="“Superloo”   After Smithy&#39;s death, Harry had to move on to look for work. He had great references from his time working for Smithy &amp; his team, which helped him secure work with various highly respected airlines.  Thus, Harry went on to work around the globe as an aviation engineer for Imperial Airways &amp; British Overseas Airways Corporation (both predecessors of British Airways), as well as for Tasman Airways (the predecessor of Air New Zealand).  Some of the locations he worked and lived were Cairo &amp; Alexandria (Egypt), Kisumu (Kenya), Sudan, Calcutta (India), London, Edinburgh (Scotland), Brindisi (Italy), Pakistan, Johannesburg (South Africa), and Dorval (Canada).   As mentioned previously Harry also married Renee (my Grandmother) during these assignments, and they had three boys: Clive, Brian &amp; Allan.  It was not until 1952 that Harry &amp; his family permanently returned to Australia.   Unfortunately Harry lost a large section of writings due to a computer issue, that were to focus on these years abroad.  However, he did complete two interesting pieces on particular events he witnessed during these times. “Superloo” is a classic story he encountered whilst working for Imperial Airways, and “Engine Maintenance whilst Flying” is Harry’s own experience of a mid air oil transfer (not to be confused with Smithy’s &amp; P.G. Taylor’s previous experience).    SUPERLOO  Imperial Airways always had their flying boat base at Ras El Tin, Alexandria, Egypt when I was transferred there in 1936 and just before I arrived there, someone whose name I won’t mention, had a bright idea on how to improve toilet facilities on their flying boats, which operated across the Mediterranean. The main aircraft used at the time I worked there, was the Short four engine Kent flying boat, operating between Alexandria and Brindisi in Italy, situated on the Adriatic coast. The flying boat used before the Kent was a Short 3 engine aircraft and two or three of these were kept at Ras El Tin as an emergency standby.  One of these was used for the development of the Superloo.  The idea was to have a cleaner toilet with less smell, which would be more comfortable for the passengers. Its basic design was to use a venturi, which would produce the vacuum to draw the contents out of the toilet bowl. As all early pilots know, a venturi was used to produce the vacuum for all blind flying instruments, so why wouldn’t it be able to produce a vacuum when installed in this toilet design, so the designers thought.  However, the venturi’s usefulness did not work too well with the Super-Loo.  From the little I was able to find out about the installation, a toggle linkage was connected to the toilet seat and when lifted up after use, it would open a valve on the vacuum line for the vacuum to do its job of removing the contents from the toilet bowl. That is about all I could find out about the design and installation.   Evidentially there must also have been some sort of shield over the discharge outlet to prevent water coming in when at sea level.  Altogether it must have been quite a complicated piece of equipment, bordering on Heath Robinson in concept. Whatever the design was, it appears the designer had complete confidence in the installation when it was finally finished.  Unfortunately, due to the loss of a Kent flying boat, which was burnt whilst being refuelled in Brindisi, two Calcuttas had to be put back into service immediately after the Kent was burnt to keep up for the loss of the one Kent. The Calcutta with the Super-Loo was to be tested, but there was no time for that and the aircraft, apart from that was in every way airworthy.  However, the designer had the good sense to tell the Flight Engineer Bert Gittus to get back to the toilet as quick as possible after the aircraft was airborne and give it a test run.  The problem arose when an American passenger had an urgent need to use the toilet. Bert went back to the toilet quickly after take-off as instructed and found it locked. He then returned to the cockpit and told Captain Baily (one of Imperial Airways well-known skippers), who instructed him to keep going back until he could make contact with the passenger who was inside the toilet.  Eventually a bad smell came drifting through the cabin and could be smelt up in the cockpit. It was then that captain bailey and Bert knew that something must have gone horribly wrong.  Finally, Bert knocked on the toilet door and called out “Are you alright?’ and the door opened and there stood an extremely angry American.  This was not a case (to use that well-known workshop parlance) when the s..t hit the fan; it hit the walls, the ceiling and the passenger, and to use Bert’s words “the Yank was not amused”. Bert said his first words were “I am going to sue you, you God damned Limey bastards”.  Quite often, when someone who had not heard about this story arrived at the Mess and Bert was present, he would be asked to tell the story. Like a lot of Cockneys, Bert was a good storyteller and he probably embellished it a little and it was always amusing to those who heard it, but I am sure the designer, like the American passenger was not amused.  The toilet in the Calcutta was situated in the freight department and as a result the passenger was able to get hold of his suitcase and after some sort of clean up and a change of clothes, he returned to the cabin.  Miribella, in Crete was a refuelling stop and Imperial kept a large, well-equipped yacht there, by the name of Imperia. It was to provide refreshments while refuelling and to accommodate passengers in an emergency. It was too late to proceed to Athens after the delay cleaning up the toilet and carrying out temporary repairs until they got to Brindisi, so Miribella was a night stop.  I never heard what became of this fiasco, or whether the passenger carried out his threat to sue. Maybe the company compensated him to quickly hush up matters.  However, there was one thing I did know and that was that the Super Loo never went back to the drawing board.  It may seem strange to some to know that a smell emanating from the toilet installed in the rear of the aircraft could be smelt in the cockpit. During a conversation with John Burgess at an Early Bird meeting many years later, he said he was well aware of this peculiar phenomenon. John was one of the youngest captains on the Mediterranean run, the other being Don Bennett of Pathfinder fame. Both these skippers flew Calcuttas and Kents.  John mentioned a very likeable character by the name of Molly Morgan, a flight engineer whom we both knew very well. John said that Molly always carried a flask of whisky when flying and would occasionally go back to the toilet to take a swig and John said he could definitely smell this while up in the cockpit.  John Burgess was an exceptionally competent pilot and discipline was very important to him. He did not say to me that he reprimanded Molly for his drinking and he may have done, but I know Molly would never drink that much that it would have affected his duties. I often wondered whether John closed his eyes to Molly’s little habits due to perhaps the need for a little stimulant when flying in some parts of the route, especially when flying over Crete. If anyone has done this, when coming in to land on approaching Mirabella, they know that air pockets are not only common, but can be severe, and a little stimulant could offer some comfort." title="" style="left:30px;top:275px;width:699px;height:2702px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1389.74px;">Unfortunately, due to the loss of a Kent flying boat, which was burnt whilst being refuelled </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1408.73px;">in Brindisi, two Calcuttas had to be put back into service immediately after the Kent was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1427.73px;">burnt to keep up for the loss of the one Kent. The Calcutta with the Super-Loo was to be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1446.72px;">tested, but there was no time for that and the aircraft, apart from that was in every way </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1465.71px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">airworthy.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1503.69px;">However, the designer had the good sense to tell the Flight Engineer Bert Gittus to get </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1522.68px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">back to the toilet as quick as possible after the aircraft was airborne and give it a test run.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1560.66px;">The problem arose when an American passenger had an urgent need to use the toilet. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1579.65px;">Bert went back to the toilet quickly after take-off as instructed and found it locked. He then </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1598.64px;">returned to the cockpit and told Captain Baily (one of Imperial Airways well-known </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1617.63px;">skippers), who instructed him to keep going back until he could make contact with the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1636.62px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">passenger who was inside the toilet.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1674.6px;">Eventually a bad smell came drifting through the cabin and could be smelt up in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1693.59px;">cockpit. It was then that captain bailey and Bert knew that something must have gone </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1712.59px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">horribly wrong.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1750.57px;">Finally, Bert knocked on the toilet door and called out “Are you alright?’ and the door </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1769.56px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">opened and there stood an extremely angry American.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1807.54px;">This was not a case (to use that well-known workshop parlance) when the s..t hit the fan; it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1826.53px;">hit the walls, the ceiling and the passenger, and to use Bert’s words “the Yank was not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1845.52px;">amused”. Bert said his first words were “I am going to sue you, you God damned Limey </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1864.51px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">bastards”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1902.49px;">Quite often, when someone who had not heard about this story arrived at the Mess and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1921.48px;">Bert was present, he would be asked to tell the story. Like a lot of Cockneys, Bert was a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1940.47px;">good storyteller and he probably embellished it a little and it was always amusing to those </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 1959.46px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">who heard it, but I am sure the designer, like the American passenger was not amused.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1997.45px;">The toilet in the Calcutta was situated in the freight department and as a result the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2016.44px;">passenger was able to get hold of his suitcase and after some sort of clean up and a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2035.43px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">change of clothes, he returned to the cabin.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2073.41px;">Miribella, in Crete was a refuelling stop and Imperial kept a large, well-equipped yacht </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2092.4px;">there, by the name of Imperia. It was to provide refreshments while refuelling and to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2111.39px;">accommodate passengers in an emergency. It was too late to proceed to Athens after the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2130.38px;">delay cleaning up the toilet and carrying out temporary repairs until they got to Brindisi, so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2149.37px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Miribella was a night stop.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2187.35px;">I never heard what became of this fiasco, or whether the passenger carried out his threat </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2206.34px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">to sue. Maybe the company compensated him to quickly hush up matters.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2244.32px;">However, there was one thing I did know and that was that the Super Loo never went back </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2263.31px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">to the drawing board.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2301.3px;">It may seem strange to some to know that a smell emanating from the toilet installed in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2320.29px;">rear of the aircraft could be smelt in the cockpit. During a conversation with John Burgess </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2339.28px;">at an Early Bird meeting many years later, he said he was well aware of this peculiar </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2358.27px;">phenomenon. John was one of the youngest captains on the Mediterranean run, the other </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2377.26px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">being Don Bennett of Pathfinder fame. Both these skippers flew Calcuttas and Kents.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2415.24px;">John mentioned a very likeable character by the name of Molly Morgan, a flight engineer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2434.23px;">whom we both knew very well. John said that Molly always carried a flask of whisky when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2453.22px;">flying and would occasionally go back to the toilet to take a swig and John said he could </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s29" style="left: 0px; top: 2472.21px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">definitely smell this while up in the cockpit.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2510.19px;">John Burgess was an exceptionally competent pilot and discipline was very important to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2529.18px;">him. He did not say to me that he reprimanded Molly for his drinking and he may have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2548.17px;">done, but I know Molly would never drink that much that it would have affected his duties. I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2567.17px;">often wondered whether John closed his eyes to Molly’s little habits due to perhaps the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2586.16px;">need for a little stimulant when flying in some parts of the route, especially when flying over </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2605.15px;">Crete. If anyone has done this, when coming in to land on approaching Mirabella, they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2624.14px;">know that air pockets are not only common, but can be severe, and a little stimulant could </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2643.13px;">offer some comfort.</span>
