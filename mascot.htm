 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4689.png" alt="“Mascot - Smithy’s Hanger”                                                                                                      Harry’s days working for Smithy must of been great days. This letter Harry wrote to the Australian Aviation Museum on the 1st March, 2005, shows some of these amazing experiences he had there.    Vice President Australian Aviation Museum PO Box 420 Panania, NSW 2213   Dear Kevin Snowball,  Your request for finance to reconstruct Smithy’s hanger is of special interest to me and for that reason it gives me great pleasure to donate $1,000.00 towards this task, to pay for one sq. metre of foundations at $400.00 and six sq. metres of flooring at $100.00 per sq. metre. I am paying for this by cheque to add a little more than what the net result would be if I had used my credit card.           It may not be known to many that Smithy had a mezzanine floor erected above the workshop, in the hanger, mainly for storage and part of the area was also set aside for a bed, which was sometimes used when one of the ground staff had worked to very early hours in the morning and decided to stay at the hanger if they were needed again early in the morning. This was done on a few occasions, but later it was my bedroom for a very long time. This came about when it was needed for a member of staff to be at the hanger early in the morning, to be present when pupils arrived to add more flying hours, and in some cases it was arranged for an instructor to arrive early to give instructions to pupils who found it difficult to get tuition at other times of the day.                   For this reason it was necessary for someone to be present to see that the aircraft had a final check and to record the hours flown by whoever was flying.  I was an assistant to Tommy Pethybridge during the 1934 barnstorming tour of NZ and after that I was employed by Kingsford Smith Air Service at Mascot. Amongst the staff, I lived closest to KSAS and the others all lived a distance away, so for that reason Tommy asked me whether I would mind starting early to carry out what was required.  However, I still had a distance to walk from my lodgings to the aerodrome, which meant getting up fairly early on many mornings so I arranged things so that I could go to where my lodgings were after finishing work for the day, have a shower etc, and an evening meal and after a short while I would walk back to the aerodrome and sleep there for the rest of the night, get up early to open the hanger entrance door and always be on the job when  required.  Those were really interesting times and I knew many who would be working late at night when there were only a few hangers on Mascot aerodrome in those days, and I would often call in and have a chat with those I knew, and sometimes be able to give a hand. I knew more than one who had sleeping arrangements at Mascot Aerodrome in those days, and one was George Dusting who later in life was one of the founders of the Early Birds and became their Hon/Secretary Treasurer.  Smithy gave me a start in aviation and I have never forgotten what early aviation gave to me. Previous to being employed by Smithy I had considerable experience for my age, having worked as an apprentice on a variety of car engines, so I was soon able to fit into aviation.  It was because of the experience I gained on the barnstorming tour of NZ in 1934, working closely with Tommy Pethybridge and later with such a highly respected person as Bobby Boulton at KSAS that I was able to join Imperial Airways in March 1936, still at a young age.  This was a most interesting time in the aviation industry, when Imperial Airways was waiting for the delivery of the Short Empire flying boats and it was not until July 4, 1936 that the Canopus, the first of the fleet of flying boats made its maiden voyage, so it was quite a while before they went into service.  At that time Imperial Airways relied on the famous old Handley Page HP42 bi-planes, together with the Atlanta and the Short Kent Flying Boat and sometimes relying on an older relic, the short Calcutta flying boat used on the Mediterranean service, operating between Brindisi in Italy and Ras-El-Tin in Alexandria, Egypt. On the 29th April 1936, I signed up with Imperial Airways for a 3-year world wide contract to work anywhere they required me on their various divisions outside of Europe, and a further three year contract, after completing the first three years.  As a result I had the pleasure of working and travelling on all those old aircraft and because of the slowness of them and the many night stops as a result along the various routes, it allowed me to get acquainted with many countries, being stationed at some, or being sent off to work at others when it was necessary to do so.  To sum up the era we are talking about, and the apparent difficulty of some people to understand the incredible progress made over the years, I would like to mention an extract from a book I am trying to complete.....   Here Harry quoted various parts of his memoirs, as seen in Early Days 1. Then he concluded this letter as....   I do not have much more time to finish my book, but if I do I might make another attempt to try and get the monument on the lines promised to me, but with Max Moore Wilton (the  present CEO and known as ‘Max the Axe’), while working with John Howard, it might be a little difficult.  Yours sincerely,  SIGNED  Harry Sergent." title="" style="left:37px;top:297px;width:689px;height:2384px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1598.27px;">waiting for the delivery of the Short Empire flying boats and it was not until July 4, 1936 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1617.26px;">that the Canopus, the first of the fleet of flying boats made its maiden voyage, so it was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1636.25px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">quite a while before they went into service.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1674.07px;">At that time Imperial Airways relied on the famous old Handley Page HP42 bi-planes, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1693.06px;">together with the Atlanta and the Short Kent Flying Boat and sometimes relying on an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1712.05px;">older relic, the short Calcutta flying boat used on the Mediterranean service, operating </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1731.04px;">between Brindisi in Italy and Ras-El-Tin in Alexandria, Egypt. On the 29</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 545.16px; top: 1731.04px;"> April 1936, I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1750.03px;">signed up with Imperial Airways for a 3-year world wide contract to work anywhere they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1769.02px;">required me on their various divisions outside of Europe, and a further three year </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1788.01px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">contract, after completing the first three years.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1825.83px;">As a result I had the pleasure of working and travelling on all those old aircraft and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1844.82px;">because of the slowness of them and the many night stops as a result along the various </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1863.81px;">routes, it allowed me to get acquainted with many countries, being stationed at some, or </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1882.8px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">being sent off to work at others when it was necessary to do so.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1920.62px;">To sum up the era we are talking about, and the apparent difficulty of some people to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1939.61px;">understand the incredible progress made over the years, I would like to mention an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1958.6px;">extract from a book I am trying to complete.....</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2015.57px;">Here Harry quoted various parts of his memoirs, as seen in Early Days 1. Then he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s8" style="left: 0px; top: 2034.56px;">concluded this letter as....</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2091.53px;">I do not have much more time to finish my book, but if I do I might make another attempt </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2110.52px;">to try and get the monument on the lines promised to me, but with Max Moore Wilton (the  </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2129.51px;">present CEO and known as ‘Max the Axe’), while working with John Howard, it might be a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2148.5px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">little difficult.</span></span>
