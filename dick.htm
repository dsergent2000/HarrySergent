 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4696.png" alt="“Dick Smith”      The below is a letter written by Harry to Dick Smith 15th July, 1993, discussing many of the “lies” that Harry felt were told about Smithy.   Dear Mr Smith.  After reading “Scotty Allan Australia’s Flying Scotsman”, I was amazed that some stories were completely fabricated and I refer firstly to page 108 and a copy of this is attached. I have highlighted what I am referring to. To rub it in, Scotty repeats this story on page 190, the very end of his book, to emphasise how he never took risks, but went on to slander Smithy about the risks he took.  I take no pleasure in having to say this, but I can assure you that there is not one word of truth in this story and this has disgusted many people who once had respect for Scotty. This completely made up story not only defamed Smith, but also his other crew members, P.G. (Bill) Taylor and John Stannage, who knew exactly what went on when the “Cross” was being prepared for the 1935 Jubilee Mail Flight, and these men were not stupid enough to fly in the “Cross” if it were not airworthy.  In addition, it defames the engineers who worked on the “Cross” at that time. These men were not only qualified engineers, but were also highly respected.  I should first of all mention that two people who worked for Smithy in 1935 are still alive, and both were on Smith’s staff when the “Cross” was being prepared for the 1935 Jubilee Mail flight. They are as follows –  - Bruce Cowan, who was A.N.A.’s first apprentice. After A.N.A. closed down Bruce worked directly for Smithy from the time he opened his new hanger in January 1933, operating K.S.A.S.  - I was employed by Smithy as assistant to Tommy Pethybridge during the 1934 tour of N.Z. and I later worked at Mascot. Both Bruce and I were on Smithy’s staff right up to his tragic disappearance.  I know you are aware that Ian Mackersey is writing a book about Smithy, and he has interviewed several people in Australia. He spent a day with me and since then there has been correspondence between us. In addition, correspondence from other Early Birds has been forwarded on to me. One of the interviews Ian had was with Scotty, and in a letter to Arch Steinbeck Ian said the following –  “Scotty Allan told me he refused to go on the flight because he believed the engines were totally stuffed. How right he was.”  This infuriated me because I found it hard to believe that anyone could tell such an outright lie. As a result I wrote to Ian Mackersey, and extracts from one letter are as follows:   Scotty had a very good record as a pilot with an incredible amount of flying experience. We also know that Smithy and many others had a very high regard for him as a pilot, but having said this Bruce and I cannot understand him saying what he did to you. From many others I worked with KSAS I had heard a lot about Scotty, but during the whole year I was working at the KSAS hanger I never saw him.  I think I may have told you that it was necessary to have one employee at the hanger very early in the morning to check aircraft when pupils came to do their solo flying. Also to keep a record of their flying hours. As I had no family ties in Sydney it was more convenient for me to carry out these duties. I slept in a small room on the mezzanine floor in the hanger, so as to be available for early morning callers (I had an arrangement with a family nearby for an evening meal and a shower). I have mentioned this because I had a hanger key and no one spent more time in that hanger during 1935 than I did.  As a result, I would have seen almost everyone who stepped into the hanger during that time and I can assure you; Scotty never paid a visit to KSAS. Bruce worked for KSAS from its inception, and when the hanger was built in January 1933. He also said that Scotty Allan never stepped into that hanger from that time right up to when Bruce left in 1936.  Bruce mentioned a book he had read called “Qantas Rising” by Hudson Fish, who listed every employee who worked for Qantas from its inception. This included junior staff, right through to the highest position and Scotty Allan was the last mentioned. He joined Qantas late in 1934. Early 1935-he test flew the D.H.86 in co-operation with Lester Brain after modifications were carried out by Qantas. He was fully occupied with his Qantas employment and stationed in Brisbane at the time of the 1935 Tasman flight, so why would Smithy ask him to go on this flight.  As you no doubt know, the original crew for the “Cross” was Smithy, Tommy Pethybridge and John Stannage, and if space had been available Jack Percival may have joined them. The crew for the “Faith” was Bill Taylor, Bob Boulton and Sid Colville as radio operator. If space was available Beau Sheil may have gone with this crew.  Smithy’s choice of Tommy was obvious. He had flown the “Cross” solo on many occasions and he was a competent pilot, besides being a competent engineer. Therefore, in addition to his qualifications as a pilot he would have been able to service the “Cross” in NZ for the return journey. This being so why would Smithy ask Scotty to fly with him, apart from the fact that Scotty was fully employed by Qantas, and how would Scotty know that the engines were totally stuffed if he hadn’t been near the KSAS for years.  Bob Boulton was also a dual-purpose man. A highly qualified engineer with many hours flying experience with the original ANA. and with “Faith”. His choice for the second aircraft was for the same reason that Tommy was chosen to go with Smithy. Smithy needed dual-purpose crewmen to act as co-pilots on both aircraft.  When it was decided to only use one aircraft Bill Taylor went with Smithy because of his navigation experience, and John Stannage had already been on many flights with Smithy as radio operator and he was also the manager of KSAS.  The purpose of my long detailed explanation about Scotty was to make sure Ian did not believe the story he told him. This was before I read Scotty’s book, which enlarged even further on the story about the engines being stuffed. As a result of what Scotty has said in his book, I wrote another letter to Ian to again warn him of this made-up story, which if repeated by Ian would have added further to the damage it could do to Smith’s reputation.  Bruce Cowan advised me that he had been approached by someone on behalf of Scotty, who wanted to know the exact date in 1935 that Scotty went to Goulburn to collect the “Cross”. Bruce’s reply was that “the Cross never went to Goulburn in 1935” and all Scotty had to do was check his log book. I wonder why he didn’t?  It was obvious that Scotty knew absolutely nothing about this Tasman flight or the reasons why the Cross had to return to Australia on the 1935 Jubilee Mail flight. The last remarks from page 108, “Spectacular failures such as this are the stuff of legends, Australians have always tended to make legends and heroes out of failures”.  This is a real low distortion and one that Scotty should be ashamed of, in view of the heroic action of Bill Taylor and the real reason for the damage to the starboard engine. In the preface of the book it is said, “He knew the business end and the engines of aircraft better than most managers and professional engineers”.  He certainly did not know anything about the condition of the engines in the Cross prior to the 1935 flight. To suggest that the engines in the Cross were in the condition Scotty described then as in is a terrible slander on the engineers who worked for Smithy at the time the Cross was prepared for the Jubilee mail flight in 1935. Most of these men are now dead and are not able to defend themselves against these cowardly lies.  The qualifications of these men and the total engineering staff working for Smithy when the Cross was prepared for this flight cannot be disputed. For this reason I feel compelled to mention their background and I will list the total engineering staff employed by Smithy at that time.   Tommy Pethybridge  In 1928, after the Pacific crossing by the Southern Cross the Wright Aeronautical Coy. Offered to check and overhaul if necessary the engines on the Cross. Naturally the offer was accepted and Wright sent Doc Maidment, their Chief Field Engineer out to Sydney. The work was carried out at the RAAF base at Richmond and Doc Maidment asked for an assistant. The RAAF asked for volunteers and Tommy, who was then in the RAAF volunteered to help. Maidment, after working with Tommy for some time was so impressed with him that he recommended Tommy to Smithy. Tommy was able to buy himself out of the RAAF in 1929 at a cost of 18 pounds, and he soon built a reputation as a top ground engineer and a close mate of Smithy during the time before ANA. was formed, and during the time he was at ANA. He became Chief Engineer with KSAS. He also became their flying instructor, and at the same time held the position of Chief Engineer.  During the time the Cross was being serviced for the 1935 Tasman flight, Tommy was engaged giving flying instructions and a few days before the take-off Smithy paid a visit to see how work was progressing, and he wanted Tommy to help with the work being carried out on the Cross. I remember well that occasion. Tommy was talking to me when Smithy approached and asked whether he could leave what he was doing and work on the Cross. Smithy explained to him that he would take the pupil. As a result Tommy was one of several qualified men who worked on the Cross at that time.  With this background of Tommy and the fact that he was scheduled to fly with Smithy on this Tasman flight, is it really believable that the engines were totally stuffed as Scotty said?  With the three engines operating under normal flying conditions the engines would have stood up to the Tasman crossing both ways and that was the belief of others at the time the oil transfer took place. When it was necessary to rely on the two engines operating on full power for most of the time, a considerable strain was placed on the two remaining engines and under these circumstances they could not have stood up to these conditions if they were totally stuffed, as Scotty said they were without having any knowledge of the engines.  The Air Accident Investigation Committee which met on Wednesday 22 May 1935, dealt with the condition of the engines in detail. Bill Taylor questioned both Tommy Pethybridge and Bob Boulton separately before the flight about the condition of the engines, and was advised separately that they were definitely satisfactory. Bill Taylor said, “On those two opinions – from Pettybridge and Boulton, who are definitely very sound engineers – I would say that the oil consumption would not have been so great that the oil supply would have run out before reaching New Zealand.  Bob Boulton  Bob also spent a while in the RAAF and was employed as a Pilot Engineer with ANA. After the closure of ANA Bob became Charlie Ulm’s Chief Engineer and flew with Ulm on most of his flights made with the Faith. After Charlie Ulm was lost, Bob was nominated by the trustees of Ulm’s estate to be fully responsible for who flew the Faith in Australia, and what it could be usefully employed at.   Bob spent a few months working for KSAS and when Tommy was occupied with his flying instructions, Bob acted as Engineer in Charge of Operations at KSAS. While in that capacity he worked on the Cross when it was being prepared for the Tasman crossing.  I would like to give more detail of Bob’s career to again emphasis the quality of the engineers Smithy employed.  When it was decided to build Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engines in Australia, Bob was approached to go to the P&amp;W works in the US to get acquainted with the assembly and overhaul of the Wasp engines, and he spent five years in Melbourne as Engineer Superintendent at the factory where the Wasps were completely manufactured.  After the factory was built in Sydney for the manufacture of the P&amp;W Double Wasp engines there was a problem in production in the early stages. Production was not as it should have been due to the person in charge of the assembly and overhaul section not being capable of carrying out his duties efficiently. The problem was overcome when the management sent for Bob, who had been transferred from Melbourne. With his vast experience, the output of Double Wasp engines was soon in full scale production and the assembly and overhaul section was operating efficiently. This was very important because a large number of engines were overhauled for the American Air Force during the war years.  Later, when it was decided to build the Rolls Merlin engine in Australia, Bob was sent to Rolls to organise the preparation for the assembly and overhaul of these engines. The Merlins were completely manufactured in Australia and the total responsibility of manufacture, assembly and testing came under Bob’s jurisdiction. The manufacture of parts was under a different section of the factory.  Bob remained at the Lidcombe factory in Sydney until his retirement. The factory was operated by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation during the war, but it was taken over by De Havilland after the war and Bob remained with them until his retirement.  Bob was awarded an MBE for his service to aviation and most people who knew what he did thought he should have been awarded something a lot better. He was an extremely modest man and things such as awards would have been the last thing he would have thought of.  This is another man slandered by Scotty’s pathetically ignorant remarks about the condition of the engines.  Bruce Cowan  Bruce was also working on the presentation of the “Cross” for the Tasman flight. Although he was a lot younger than Tommy and Bob, he was by then holding a licence endorsed for the maintenance of J5 engines. He had by that time gained valuable experience, firstly with A.N.A., as their first apprentice and later at K.S.A.S.  Not long after Smithy sold his interest in K.S.A.S. to Eastern Air Transport Ltd, Bruce was sent to Adelaide as Chief Engineer and co-pilot on the inauguration of the Adelaide to Darwin Air Mail Service.   During the war years he was employed as Flight Shed Inspector-In-Charge of the Beaufort Division, when Beaufort Bombers were built in Australia.  I emphasis again, Bruce was another qualified person who worked on the “Cross” when it was being prepared for the Tasman crossing. As mentioned earlier, Bruce is still alive and although he cannot read due to his poor eyesight, he is acquainted with the controversial parts of Scotty’s book and he is a very angry man.   Gene Heatherington  Gene, although young at the time he worked for Smithy, was highly respected by all who worked with him, both as a man and an engineer. As Gene was engaged on the maintenance of other aircraft he was only able to spend limited time on the “Cross” when it was prepared for the 1935 Tasman crossing. I again emphasis that Gene, like all those who worked on the Cross, was a qualified engineer. He went to England just before the end of 1935 and had a good future there as an engineer. However, that was not to be. He joined the R.A.F. and rose to the rank of Flt. Lieutenant before the war and was killed on the first Kiel Canal raid.  Gene is another who is slandered by Scotty’s remarks.   Leo Walsh  Although Leo was only employed as a cleaner of aircraft and parts etc. he was a very reliable person. He was capable of being able to assist with engineering work, but was never asked to do so. Tommy and Bob would only allow qualified engineers to work on overhaul or maintenance of aircraft.   During that time, like Gene, I was fully employed on the maintenance of other aircraft and spent very little time on the Cross on that occasion, but I do know that the Cross had a thorough check before that Tasman crossing.  Although CWA Scott has nothing to do with my criticism of what Scotty has said about Smithy, it is another example of a story where accusations are ridiculous in view of the dates he quotes. It is not necessary for me to enlarge on that, but it is another example of what to believe in Scotty’s book.  I have spoken to several people who worked in aviation during Smithy’s time and who also know Scotty quite well. All I can say is that they are absolutely disgusted with the way he has set out to knock his old mates.  Some have suggested that his age may have played a part in what he has said and that he is suffering from illusions. That may be so, due to the things he has said that have no truth in the stories, but Elizabeth Shearman said:  “I hope that this book, an edited version of many long sessions with the tape recorder over a period of several years”.  If that is the case he would have been a lot younger when he made most of the tapes.  Others have said that Elizabeth Shearman should carry a lot of the blame, due to Scotty’s age, but that sounds like shooting the messenger. That is one side of the coin, but it appears she did not research important stories as quoted by Scotty and was prepared to listen to anything that Scotty had to say. An experienced biographer, especially one writing a book on early aviation, would have checked Scotty’s log book and carefully scrutinised every detail, especially the dates. If she had done that it would have avoided so much anger amongst many of the “early birds” still alive, but more importantly it would not have damaged Smithy’s and his mates reputations.  Page 45. I have highlighted what Scotty said on the enclosed page. Not one person I spoke to could get over his diatribe. It is another example of Scotty trying to make himself so superior to Smithy and making a fool of himself at the same time.  Page 65. Here is Scotty giving lessons to Smithy (around 1932) in blind flying, something Smithy couldn’t do. If Smithy required lessons in blind flying, I wonder how he managed on his Pacific and Tasman flights in 1928, when he had to fly under the most atrocious conditions. There were only two in the pilot seats at that time and although Charlie Ulm was a highly respected person as an organiser and an administrator he was not an experienced pilot. He never claimed to be, so the real flying was always left to Smithy.  I was not employed by A.N.A. but I have been assured by Bruce Cowan, who was with A.N.A. from its inception, that Smithy insisted on checking every new pilot on their blind flying capability and this included Scotty. It appears that there is no limit to Scotty’s effort to belittle Smithy.  Scotty said that Smithy’s parting with Ulm was devastating in that Smithy had nobody like Ulm, who could advise him and keep him from indulging himself in ill-prepared flights.  I have already mentioned the respect I have for Ulm as far as his organising ability was concerned, but here again Scotty seems to think that some people like himself are indispensable. John Stannage and Beau Shiel, together with Smithy, put a tremendous amount of work into the preparation of his last record attempt. Smithy also took Tommy Pethebridge and Bob Boulton, two of Australia’s most experienced ground engineers with him to the States, and then on to England to prepare the Lady Southern Cross for his last record attempt. What should be known was why Smithy made that last flight, and why he was always battling so hard to get his Tasman Air service into operation.  He fought a losing battle against established vested interests who did absolutely nothing to pioneer the air routes that Smithy pioneered, but they were ready to jump in when Smithy proved that regular air services were possible at that time.  After Smithy was lost, I was talking to Beau Shiel and John Stannage before departing for England to join Imperial Airways, and during this long conversation with them they said that they had been trying to persuade Smithy to cancel this record attempt due to his health at that time. However, they were having a problem getting money owed to Smithy from the sales of the Cross to the government.  While on that subject, it should also be remembered that Smithy could have sold the Cross to America or Anthony Fokker for a higher price than that paid by the Australian government. He was a patriot and he got kicked in the guts for being so. It now appears that Scotty is carrying on with the same lousy treatment Smithy received all those years ago, and this time from someone that Smithy treated as a mate.  Scotty said that “Smithy was a good fellow who got carried away by publicity”. On the one hand Smithy is described as a good bloke and then he is denigrated by Scotty. This sounds like the mafia who always send flowers to their victim’s funeral.  Scotty said “He (Smithy) said that I was the best pilot in the world. Of course, nobody took any notice. To be noticed you’ve got to go out and pound your own chest --- something which I wasn’t going to do. Smithy however, was good at chest pounding”.  Apart from Bruce Cowan and myself there were many others who were also disgusted about this remark. Smithy was not one little bit like that.  After reading Scotty’s book it is obvious that he is not shy at what he calls “chest pounding”.  Smithy was highly respected by his crews, his staff and all who knew him. When I was working for Imperial Airways in Kenya I corresponded with John Stannage, and in one of his letters in 1937 (which I still have) John said:  “You will see by this letter-head that things have changed considerably since we lost our dear old boss”.  During a conversation with Joy Taylor (Bill Taylor’s widow) she told me that Bill on many occasions had told her about his admiration for Smith, both as a pilot and as a man. When Bill Taylor heard of Smithy’s tragedy he said: 	 “He had the enlightened spirit of the born pioneer. What ever the risk, the way into the unknown was always an irresistible invitation to him”.  Smithy was respected worldwide and from America Jimmy Doolittle wrote:  “Smithy was one of the finest gentlemen it was my good fortune to know. He was pioneer, who made great contributions to the progress of aeronautics. He is truly one of the outstanding names in the history of aviation. His loss is a tragedy, not only for Australia, but for the world”.  These comments coming from such eminent airmen are good enough for me and I know who best to believe.  I am a very angry man after reading Scotty’s book and my mate Bruce Cowan feels the same. Unfortunately, Bruce’s eyesight prevents him writing to you, but I can assure you he feels just as bitter about Scotty (a man he once admired) as I do.  If Scotty had stuck to his own achievements and told the truth it would have been an interesting story about early aviation, but sadly he chose otherwise and lost a lot of one-time admirers in doing so.   It has not been easy writing this letter, but I have been morally compelled to do so to make some small effort to protect the names of men I knew well and worked with, and who did not deserve to be slandered by Scotty.  Unfortunately, many who have read Scotty’s book will be influenced in their thinking about Smithy, and those who worked for him, and this cannot be rectified.  If a reprint amends the errors and lies, then this will not be able to get to those who purchased the original run of books.   THE DAMAGE DONE IS UNFORGIVABLE.

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s17" style="left: 0px; top: 61.68px;"><span class="xr_s8" style="">the “lies” that Harry felt were told about Smithy.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 118.32px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Dear Mr Smith.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 156.14px;">After reading “Scotty Allan Australia’s Flying Scotsman”, I was amazed that some </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 175.13px;">stories were completely fabricated and I refer firstly to page 108 and a copy of this is </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 194.12px;">attached. I have highlighted what I am referring to. To rub it in, Scotty repeats this story </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 213.11px;">on page 190, the very end of his book, to emphasise how he never took risks, but went </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 232.1px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">on to slander Smithy about the risks he took.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 269.92px;">I take no pleasure in having to say this, but I can assure you that there is not one word </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 288.91px;">of truth in this story and this has disgusted many people who once had respect for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 307.9px;">Scotty. This completely made up story not only defamed Smith, but also his other crew </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 326.89px;">members, P.G. (Bill) Taylor and John Stannage, who knew exactly what went on when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 345.88px;">the “Cross” was being prepared for the 1935 Jubilee Mail Flight, and these men were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 364.87px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">not stupid enough to fly in the “Cross” if it were not airworthy.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 402.69px;">In addition, it defames the engineers who worked on the “Cross” at that time. These </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 421.68px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">men were not only qualified engineers, but were also highly respected.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 459.49px;">I should first of all mention that two people who worked for Smithy in 1935 are still alive, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 478.48px;">and both were on Smith’s staff when the “Cross” was being prepared for the 1935 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 497.47px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Jubilee Mail flight. They are as follows –</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 535.29px;">- Bruce Cowan, who was A.N.A.’s first apprentice. After A.N.A. closed down </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 554.28px;">Bruce worked directly for Smithy from the time he opened his new hanger in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 573.27px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">January 1933, operating K.S.A.S.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 611.09px;">- I was employed by Smithy as assistant to Tommy Pethybridge during the 1934 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 630.08px;">tour of N.Z. and I later worked at Mascot. Both Bruce and I were on Smithy’s staff </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 649.07px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">right up to his tragic disappearance.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 686.88px;">I know you are aware that Ian Mackersey is writing a book about Smithy, and he has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 705.87px;">interviewed several people in Australia. He spent a day with me and since then there </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 724.87px;">has been correspondence between us. In addition, correspondence from other Early </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 743.86px;">Birds has been forwarded on to me. One of the interviews Ian had was with Scotty, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 762.85px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">in a letter to Arch Steinbeck Ian said the following –</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 800.66px;">“Scotty Allan told me he refused to go on the flight because he believed the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 819.65px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">engines were totally stuffed. How right he was.”</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 857.47px;">This infuriated me because I found it hard to believe that anyone could tell such an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 876.46px;">outright lie. As a result I wrote to Ian Mackersey, and extracts from one letter are as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 895.45px;">follows:</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 952.09px;">Scotty had a very good record as a pilot with an incredible amount of flying experience. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 971.08px;">We also know that Smithy and many others had a very high regard for him as a pilot, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 990.07px;">but having said this Bruce and I cannot understand him saying what he did to you. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1009.06px;">From many others I worked with KSAS I had heard a lot about Scotty, but during the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1028.05px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">whole year I was working at the KSAS hanger I never saw him.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1065.87px;">I think I may have told you that it was necessary to have one employee at the hanger </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1084.86px;">very early in the morning to check aircraft when pupils came to do their solo flying. Also </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1103.85px;">to keep a record of their flying hours. As I had no family ties in Sydney it was more </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1122.84px;">convenient for me to carry out these duties. I slept in a small room on the mezzanine </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1141.83px;">floor in the hanger, so as to be available for early morning callers (I had an arrangement </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1160.82px;">with a family nearby for an evening meal and a shower). I have mentioned this because </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1179.81px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">I had a hanger key and no one spent more time in that hanger during 1935 than I did.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1217.63px;">As a result, I would have seen almost everyone who stepped into the hanger during </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1236.62px;">that time and I can assure you; Scotty never paid a visit to KSAS. Bruce worked for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1255.61px;">KSAS from its inception, and when the hanger was built in January 1933. He also said </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1274.6px;">that Scotty Allan never stepped into that hanger from that time right up to when Bruce </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1293.59px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">left in 1936.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1331.41px;">Bruce mentioned a book he had read called “Qantas Rising” by Hudson Fish, who listed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1350.4px;">every employee who worked for Qantas from its inception. This included junior staff, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1369.39px;">right through to the highest position and Scotty Allan was the last mentioned. He joined </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1388.38px;">Qantas late in 1934. Early 1935-he test flew the D.H.86 in co-operation with Lester </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1407.37px;">Brain after modifications were carried out by Qantas. He was fully occupied with his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1426.36px;">Qantas employment and stationed in Brisbane at the time of the 1935 Tasman flight, so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1445.35px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">why would Smithy ask him to go on this flight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1483.17px;">As you no doubt know, the original crew for the “Cross” was Smithy, Tommy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1502.16px;">Pethybridge and John Stannage, and if space had been available Jack Percival may </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1521.15px;">have joined them. The crew for the “Faith” was Bill Taylor, Bob Boulton and Sid Colville </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1540.14px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">as radio operator. If space was available Beau Sheil may have gone with this crew.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1577.96px;">Smithy’s choice of Tommy was obvious. He had flown the “Cross” solo on many </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1596.95px;">occasions and he was a competent pilot, besides being a competent engineer. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1615.94px;">Therefore, in addition to his qualifications as a pilot he would have been able to service </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1634.93px;">the “Cross” in NZ for the return journey. This being so why would Smithy ask Scotty to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1653.92px;">fly with him, apart from the fact that Scotty was fully employed by Qantas, and how </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1672.91px;">would Scotty know that the engines were totally stuffed if he hadn’t been near the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1691.9px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">KSAS for years.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1729.72px;">Bob Boulton was also a dual-purpose man. A highly qualified engineer with many hours </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1748.71px;">flying experience with the original ANA. and with “Faith”. His choice for the second </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1767.7px;">aircraft was for the same reason that Tommy was chosen to go with Smithy. Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1786.69px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">needed dual-purpose crewmen to act as co-pilots on both aircraft.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1824.51px;">When it was decided to only use one aircraft Bill Taylor went with Smithy because of his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1843.5px;">navigation experience, and John Stannage had already been on many flights with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1862.49px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Smithy as radio operator and he was also the manager of KSAS.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1900.3px;">The purpose of my long detailed explanation about Scotty was to make sure Ian did not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1919.29px;">believe the story he told him. This was before I read Scotty’s book, which enlarged </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1938.28px;">even further on the story about the engines being stuffed. As a result of what Scotty has </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1957.27px;">said in his book, I wrote another letter to Ian to again warn him of this made-up story, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1976.27px;">which if repeated by Ian would have added further to the damage it could do to Smith’s </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1995.26px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">reputation.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2033.07px;">Bruce Cowan advised me that he had been approached by someone on behalf of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2052.06px;">Scotty, who wanted to know the exact date in 1935 that Scotty went to Goulburn to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2071.05px;">collect the “Cross”. Bruce’s reply was that “the Cross never went to Goulburn in 1935” </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2090.04px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">and all Scotty had to do was check his log book. I wonder why he didn’t?</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2127.86px;">It was obvious that Scotty knew absolutely nothing about this Tasman flight or the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2146.85px;">reasons why the Cross had to return to Australia on the 1935 Jubilee Mail flight. The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2165.84px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">last remarks from page 108,</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 2184.83px;">“Spectacular failures such as this are the stuff of legends, Australians have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 2203.82px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">always tended to make legends and heroes out of failures”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2241.64px;">This is a real low distortion and one that Scotty should be ashamed of, in view of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2260.63px;">heroic action of Bill Taylor and the real reason for the damage to the starboard engine. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2279.62px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">In the preface of the book it is said,</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 2298.61px;">“He knew the business end and the engines of aircraft better than most </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 2317.6px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">managers and professional engineers”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2355.42px;">He certainly did not know anything about the condition of the engines in the Cross prior </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2374.41px;">to the 1935 flight. To suggest that the engines in the Cross were in the condition Scotty </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2393.4px;">described then as in is a terrible slander on the engineers who worked for Smithy at the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2412.39px;">time the Cross was prepared for the Jubilee mail flight in 1935. Most of these men are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2431.38px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">now dead and are not able to defend themselves against these cowardly lies.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2469.2px;">The qualifications of these men and the total engineering staff working for Smithy when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2488.19px;">the Cross was prepared for this flight cannot be disputed. For this reason I feel </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2507.18px;">compelled to mention their background and I will list the total engineering staff </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2526.17px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">employed by Smithy at that time.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2582.81px;"><span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">Tommy Pethybridge</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2620.79px;">In 1928, after the Pacific crossing by the Southern Cross the Wright Aeronautical Coy. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2639.78px;">Offered to check and overhaul if necessary the engines on the Cross. Naturally the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2658.77px;">offer was accepted and Wright sent Doc Maidment, their Chief Field Engineer out to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2677.76px;">Sydney. The work was carried out at the RAAF base at Richmond and Doc Maidment </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2696.75px;">asked for an assistant. The RAAF asked for volunteers and Tommy, who was then in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2715.74px;">the RAAF volunteered to help. Maidment, after working with Tommy for some time was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2734.73px;">so impressed with him that he recommended Tommy to Smithy. Tommy was able to buy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2753.73px;">himself out of the RAAF in 1929 at a cost of 18 pounds, and he soon built a reputation </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2772.72px;">as a top ground engineer and a close mate of Smithy during the time before ANA. was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2791.71px;">formed, and during the time he was at ANA. He became Chief Engineer with KSAS. He </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2810.7px;">also became their flying instructor, and at the same time held the position of Chief </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2829.69px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Engineer.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2867.5px;">During the time the Cross was being serviced for the 1935 Tasman flight, Tommy was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2886.49px;">engaged giving flying instructions and a few days before the take-off Smithy paid a visit </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2905.49px;">to see how work was progressing, and he wanted Tommy to help with the work being </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2924.48px;">carried out on the Cross. I remember well that occasion. Tommy was talking to me </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2943.47px;">when Smithy approached and asked whether he could leave what he was doing and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2962.46px;">work on the Cross. Smithy explained to him that he would take the pupil. As a result </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2981.45px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Tommy was one of several qualified men who worked on the Cross at that time.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3019.26px;">With this background of Tommy and the fact that he was scheduled to fly with Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3038.25px;">on this Tasman flight, is it really believable that the engines were totally stuffed as </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3057.25px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Scotty said?</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3095.06px;">With the three engines operating under normal flying conditions the engines would have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3114.05px;">stood up to the Tasman crossing both ways and that was the belief of others at the time </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3133.04px;">the oil transfer took place. When it was necessary to rely on the two engines operating </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3152.03px;">on full power for most of the time, a considerable strain was placed on the two </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3171.02px;">remaining engines and under these circumstances they could not have stood up to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3190.01px;">these conditions if they were <span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">totally stuffed,</span> as Scotty said they were without having any </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3209.01px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">knowledge of the engines.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3246.82px;">The Air Accident Investigation Committee which met on Wednesday 22 May 1935, dealt </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3265.81px;">with the condition of the engines in detail. Bill Taylor questioned both Tommy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3284.8px;">Pethybridge and Bob Boulton separately before the flight about the condition of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3303.79px;">engines, and was advised separately that they were definitely satisfactory. Bill Taylor </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3322.78px;">said, “On those two opinions – from Pettybridge and Boulton, who are definitely very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3341.77px;">sound engineers – I would say that the oil consumption would not have been so great </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3360.77px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">that the oil supply would have run out before reaching New Zealand.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3398.58px;"><span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">Bob Boulton</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3436.56px;">Bob also spent a while in the RAAF and was employed as a Pilot Engineer with ANA. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3455.55px;">After the closure of ANA Bob became Charlie Ulm’s Chief Engineer and flew with Ulm </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3474.54px;">on most of his flights made with the Faith. After Charlie Ulm was lost, Bob was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3493.53px;">nominated by the trustees of Ulm’s estate to be fully responsible for who flew the Faith </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3512.53px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">in Australia, and what it could be usefully employed at. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3550.34px;">Bob spent a few months working for KSAS and when Tommy was occupied with his </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3569.33px;">flying instructions, Bob acted as Engineer in Charge of Operations at KSAS. While in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3588.32px;">that capacity he worked on the Cross when it was being prepared for the Tasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3607.31px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">crossing.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3645.13px;">I would like to give more detail of Bob’s career to again emphasis the quality of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3664.12px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">engineers Smithy employed.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3701.94px;">When it was decided to build Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engines in Australia, Bob was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3720.93px;">approached to go to the P&amp;W works in the US to get acquainted with the assembly and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3739.92px;">overhaul of the Wasp engines, and he spent five years in Melbourne as Engineer </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3758.91px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Superintendent at the factory where the Wasps were completely manufactured.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3796.72px;">After the factory was built in Sydney for the manufacture of the P&amp;W Double Wasp </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3815.71px;">engines there was a problem in production in the early stages. Production was not as it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3834.71px;">should have been due to the person in charge of the assembly and overhaul section not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3853.7px;">being capable of carrying out his duties efficiently. The problem was overcome when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3872.69px;">the management sent for Bob, who had been transferred from Melbourne. With his vast </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3891.68px;">experience, the output of Double Wasp engines was soon in full scale production and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3910.67px;">the assembly and overhaul section was operating efficiently. This was very important </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3929.66px;">because a large number of engines were overhauled for the American Air Force during </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3948.65px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">the war years.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3986.47px;">Later, when it was decided to build the Rolls Merlin engine in Australia, Bob was sent to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4005.46px;">Rolls to organise the preparation for the assembly and overhaul of these engines. The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4024.45px;">Merlins were completely manufactured in Australia and the total responsibility of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4043.44px;">manufacture, assembly and testing came under Bob’s jurisdiction. The manufacture of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4062.43px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">parts was under a different section of the factory.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4100.24px;">Bob remained at the Lidcombe factory in Sydney until his retirement. The factory was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4119.23px;">operated by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation during the war, but it was taken </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4138.23px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">over by De Havilland after the war and Bob remained with them until his retirement.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4176.04px;">Bob was awarded an MBE for his service to aviation and most people who knew what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4195.03px;">he did thought he should have been awarded something a lot better. He was an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4214.02px;">extremely modest man and things such as awards would have been the last thing he </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4233.01px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">would have thought of.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4270.83px;">This is another man slandered by Scotty’s pathetically ignorant remarks about the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4289.82px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">condition of the engines.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4327.64px;"><span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">Bruce Cowan</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4365.45px;">Bruce was also working on the presentation of the “Cross” for the Tasman flight. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4384.44px;">Although he was a lot younger than Tommy and Bob, he was by then holding a licence </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4403.43px;">endorsed for the maintenance of J5 engines. He had by that time gained valuable </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4422.42px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">experience, firstly with A.N.A., as their first apprentice and later at K.S.A.S.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4460.24px;">Not long after Smithy sold his interest in K.S.A.S. to Eastern Air Transport Ltd, Bruce </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4479.23px;">was sent to Adelaide as Chief Engineer and co-pilot on the inauguration of the Adelaide </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4498.22px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">to Darwin Air Mail Service. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4536.04px;">During the war years he was employed as Flight Shed Inspector-In-Charge of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4555.03px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Beaufort Division, when Beaufort Bombers were built in Australia.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4592.84px;">I emphasis again, Bruce was another qualified person who worked on the “Cross” when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4611.83px;">it was being prepared for the Tasman crossing. As mentioned earlier, Bruce is still alive </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4630.83px;">and although he cannot read due to his poor eyesight, he is acquainted with the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4649.82px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">controversial parts of Scotty’s book and he is a very angry man.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4706.46px;"><span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">Gene Heatherington</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4744.27px;">Gene, although young at the time he worked for Smithy, was highly respected by all </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4763.26px;">who worked with him, both as a man and an engineer. As Gene was engaged on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4782.25px;">maintenance of other aircraft he was only able to spend limited time on the “Cross” </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4801.25px;">when it was prepared for the 1935 Tasman crossing. I again emphasis that Gene, like </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4820.24px;">all those who worked on the Cross, was a qualified engineer. He went to England just </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4839.23px;">before the end of 1935 and had a good future there as an engineer. However, that was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4858.22px;">not to be. He joined the R.A.F. and rose to the rank of Flt. Lieutenant before the war </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4877.21px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">and was killed on the first Kiel Canal raid.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4915.02px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Gene is another who is slandered by Scotty’s remarks.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4971.67px;"><span class="xr_s46 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">Leo Walsh</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5009.48px;">Although Leo was only employed as a cleaner of aircraft and parts etc. he was a very </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5028.47px;">reliable person. He was capable of being able to assist with engineering work, but was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5047.46px;">never asked to do so. Tommy and Bob would only allow qualified engineers to work on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5066.45px;">overhaul or maintenance of aircraft.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5123.26px;">During that time, like Gene, I was fully employed on the maintenance of other aircraft </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5142.25px;">and spent very little time on the Cross on that occasion, but I do know that the Cross </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5161.24px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">had a thorough check before that Tasman crossing.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5199.06px;">Although CWA Scott has nothing to do with my criticism of what Scotty has said about </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5218.05px;">Smithy, it is another example of a story where accusations are ridiculous in view of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5237.04px;">dates he quotes. It is not necessary for me to enlarge on that, but it is another example </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5256.03px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">of what to believe in Scotty’s book.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5293.85px;">I have spoken to several people who worked in aviation during Smithy’s time and who </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5312.84px;">also know Scotty quite well. All I can say is that they are absolutely disgusted with the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5331.83px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">way he has set out to knock his old mates.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5369.64px;">Some have suggested that his age may have played a part in what he has said and that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5388.63px;">he is suffering from illusions. That may be so, due to the things he has said that have </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5407.62px;">no truth in the stories, but Elizabeth Shearman said:</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 5445.44px;">“I hope that this book, an edited version of many long sessions with the tape </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 5464.43px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">recorder over a period of several years”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5502.25px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">If that is the case he would have been a lot younger when he made most of the tapes.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5540.06px;">Others have said that Elizabeth Shearman should carry a lot of the blame, due to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5559.05px;">Scotty’s age, but that sounds like shooting the messenger. That is one side of the coin, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5578.04px;">but it appears she did not research important stories as quoted by Scotty and was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5597.03px;">prepared to listen to anything that Scotty had to say. An experienced biographer, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5616.03px;">especially one writing a book on early aviation, would have checked Scotty’s log book </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5635.02px;">and carefully scrutinised every detail, especially the dates. If she had done that it would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5654.01px;">have avoided so much anger amongst many of the “early birds” still alive, but more </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5673px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">importantly it would not have damaged Smithy’s and his mates reputations.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5710.81px;">Page 45. I have highlighted what Scotty said on the enclosed page. Not one person I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5729.8px;">spoke to could get over his diatribe. It is another example of Scotty trying to make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5748.79px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">himself so superior to Smithy and making a fool of himself at the same time.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5786.61px;">Page 65. Here is Scotty giving lessons to Smithy (around 1932) in blind flying, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5805.6px;">something Smithy couldn’t do. If Smithy required lessons in blind flying, I wonder how </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5824.59px;">he managed on his Pacific and Tasman flights in 1928, when he had to fly under the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5843.58px;">most atrocious conditions. There were only two in the pilot seats at that time and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5862.57px;">although Charlie Ulm was a highly respected person as an organiser and an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5881.56px;">administrator he was not an experienced pilot. He never claimed to be, so the real flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5900.55px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">was always left to Smithy.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5938.37px;">I was not employed by A.N.A. but I have been assured by Bruce Cowan, who was with </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5957.36px;">A.N.A. from its inception, that Smithy insisted on checking every new pilot on their blind </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5976.35px;">flying capability and this included Scotty. It appears that there is no limit to Scotty’s </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5995.34px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">effort to belittle Smithy.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6033.16px;">Scotty said that Smithy’s parting with Ulm was devastating in that Smithy had nobody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6052.15px;">like Ulm, who could advise him and keep him from indulging himself in ill-prepared </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6071.14px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">flights.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6108.96px;">I have already mentioned the respect I have for Ulm as far as his organising ability was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6127.95px;">concerned, but here again Scotty seems to think that some people like himself are </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6146.94px;">indispensable. John Stannage and Beau Shiel, together with Smithy, put a tremendous </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6165.93px;">amount of work into the preparation of his last record attempt. Smithy also took Tommy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6184.92px;">Pethebridge and Bob Boulton, two of Australia’s most experienced ground engineers </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6203.91px;">with him to the States, and then on to England to prepare the Lady Southern Cross for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6222.9px;">his last record attempt. What should be known was why Smithy made that last flight, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6241.89px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">and why he was always battling so hard to get his Tasman Air service into operation.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6279.71px;">He fought a losing battle against established vested interests who did absolutely </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6298.7px;">nothing to pioneer the air routes that Smithy pioneered, but they were ready to jump in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6317.69px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">when Smithy proved that regular air services were possible at that time.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6355.5px;">After Smithy was lost, I was talking to Beau Shiel and John Stannage before departing </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6374.49px;">for England to join Imperial Airways, and during this long conversation with them they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6393.49px;">said that they had been trying to persuade Smithy to cancel this record attempt due to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6412.48px;">his health at that time. However, they were having a problem getting money owed to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6431.47px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Smithy from the sales of the Cross to the government.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6469.28px;">While on that subject, it should also be remembered that Smithy could have sold the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6488.27px;">Cross to America or Anthony Fokker for a higher price than that paid by the Australian </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6507.26px;">government. He was a patriot and he got kicked in the guts for being so. It now appears </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6526.25px;">that Scotty is carrying on with the same lousy treatment Smithy received all those years </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6545.25px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">ago, and this time from someone that Smithy treated as a mate.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6583.06px;">Scotty said that “Smithy was a good fellow who got carried away by publicity”. On the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6602.05px;">one hand Smithy is described as a good bloke and then he is denigrated by Scotty. This </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6621.04px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">sounds like the mafia who always send flowers to their victim’s funeral.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6658.86px;">Scotty said “He (Smithy) said that I was the best pilot in the world. Of course, nobody </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6677.85px;">took any notice. To be noticed you’ve got to go out and pound your own chest --- </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6696.84px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">something which I wasn’t going to do. Smithy however, was good at chest pounding”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6734.66px;">Apart from Bruce Cowan and myself there were many others who were also disgusted </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6753.65px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">about this remark. Smithy was not one little bit like that.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6791.46px;">After reading Scotty’s book it is obvious that he is not shy at what he calls “chest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6810.45px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">pounding”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6848.27px;">Smithy was highly respected by his crews, his staff and all who knew him. When I was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6867.26px;">working for Imperial Airways in Kenya I corresponded with John Stannage, and in one </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6886.25px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">of his letters in 1937 (which I still have) John said:</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 6924.07px;">“You will see by this letter-head that things have changed considerably since we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 6943.06px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">lost our dear old boss”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6980.87px;">During a conversation with Joy Taylor (Bill Taylor’s widow) she told me that Bill on many </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6999.86px;">occasions had told her about his admiration for Smith, both as a pilot and as a man. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7018.85px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">When Bill Taylor heard of Smithy’s tragedy he said:</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7056.84px;">“He had the enlightened spirit of the born pioneer. What ever the risk, the way </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7075.83px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">into the unknown was always an irresistible invitation to him”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7113.64px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">Smithy was respected worldwide and from America Jimmy Doolittle wrote:</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7151.46px;">“Smithy was one of the finest gentlemen it was my good fortune to know. He was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7170.45px;">pioneer, who made great contributions to the progress of aeronautics. He is truly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7189.44px;">one of the outstanding names in the history of aviation. His loss is a tragedy, not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 48px; top: 7208.43px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">only for Australia, but for the world”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7246.25px;">These comments coming from such eminent airmen are good enough for me and I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7265.24px;">know who best to believe.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7303.05px;">I am a very angry man after reading Scotty’s book and my mate Bruce Cowan feels the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7322.04px;">same. Unfortunately, Bruce’s eyesight prevents him writing to you, but I can assure you </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7341.03px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">he feels just as bitter about Scotty (a man he once admired) as I do.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7378.85px;">If Scotty had stuck to his own achievements and told the truth it would have been an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7397.84px;">interesting story about early aviation, but sadly he chose otherwise and lost a lot of one-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7416.83px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">time admirers in doing so. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7454.65px;">It has not been easy writing this letter, but I have been morally compelled to do so to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7473.64px;">make some small effort to protect the names of men I knew well and worked with, and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7492.63px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">who did not deserve to be slandered by Scotty.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7530.45px;">Unfortunately, many who have read Scotty’s book will be influenced in their thinking </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7549.44px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">about Smithy, and those who worked for him, and this cannot be rectified.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s14 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7587.25px;">If a reprint amends the errors and lies, then this will not be able to get to those who </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7606.24px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">purchased the original run of books. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s43 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7644.06px;"><span class="xr_s14 xr_italic" style="">THE DAMAGE DONE IS UNFORGIVABLE.</span></span>
