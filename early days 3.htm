 <img class="xr_ap" src="index_htm_files/4670.png" alt="“Those Early Days” 3   TRANS TASMAN FLIGHT  At last the time had arrived for the flight so many in Australia and New Zealand had been waiting for. The time taken in preparing for this flight, and the important non-stop flight across Australia caused some ill informed people to criticize the delay after it was first announced that the Tasman flight was being planned. Smithy became use to these very ignorant critics who knew nothing about the necessity to thoroughly prepare for such flights, and there was a very good reason for the time taken, as already explained.   Smithy and crew took off from Richmond aerodrome, outside of Sydney at dusk on the 10th September 1928, and their reason for leaving at this time of day was to arrive at Christchurch in daylight on an aerodrome they had never seen. They were carrying 700 gallons of petrol and there were no problems with the take-off. A very careful weather check told them that the weather was very good on both sides of the Tasman and this turned out to be accurate, but this forecast was all they could get because there was no shipping at that time in the middle of the Tasman, that could have given them a true picture of the weather they were to run into. Smithy had already plenty to say about the Tasman Sea and what he and his crew might expect, as already mentioned.   People today who fly over the Tasman as a passenger, one way or the other from the several departure points in both Australia and New Zealand, enjoying a drink and a nice meal, in a total time of approximately two, or a little more hours, would perhaps find it difficult to believe what Smithy and his crew had to put up with, as far as the weather and the time taken was concerned, when they made the first crossing of their Tasman Sea.    In addition the reception Smithy and his Crew received throughout New Zealand would perhaps also be hard to understand today, but this was a time when pioneer flights were so important, and to many people hard to accept the future of aviation.  Smithy did not exaggerate when he later described that experience in the “Old Bus” (the story of his many pioneer flights), when he mentioned the notorious weather they ran into. When that was first published on the 28th July 1932, Charles Ulm his Co-pilot, Harold Litchfield his Navigator and Tom Mc Williams his Wireless Operator were very much alive and all had a very good reason to confirm in detail what they experienced. The damaged done to the “Southern Cross” after it landed at Christchurch NZ on that historic flight was further evidence of the damage done by the weather.  As already mentioned, aircraft in those days had no chance of avoiding bad weather because of their inability to fly high enough to get away from it. Smithy, more than anyone else amongst the aviation pioneers had more than his share of flying under difficult weather conditions but his experience on that first Tasman crossing was the very worst. What he predicted could happen, did happen.  The weather aspect mentioned in the “Old Bus” about the first Tasman flight was taken from Smithy’s log book, with further comments about their difficulty in trying to avoid the weather they experienced in connection with this flight, and it is from this that I quote what Smithy had to say about the weather and the very serious problems this caused them. At one stage they must have thought the extremely bad weather would land them in the same fate as Moncrieff and Hood.  Rather than pluck out parts of this as others have done, I believe the whole of what Smithy had to say should be told exactly as he said it and I make no excuse for doing so and quoting it in full, because what Smithy had to say will give readers an example of the risks pioneer flyers had to take in the days, when they could not escape the bad weather they ran into from time to time, and the great risk this was to their lives making those pioneer flights, especially when flying over oceans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           When the “Old Bus” was written three years after the first Tasman flight, Smithy said that memories of that Tasman flight were still vivid, and this is exactly what Smithy had to say about the first Tasman flight.   “We buzzed along very well until about 11 o’clock when I noticed a long way ahead the flickering of lightning which spread out over such a wide front, that to have avoided it would have meant a very wide detour, and consequent loss of time. We debated whether we should go on through it, or whether we should waste time and petrol by going round it. Airmen have a dread of lightning, since aeroplanes are not earthed, and in bad electric storms one does not know what to expect. Furthermore, there is still very little information available about the effect of electric storms on aircraft.                                             We flew on, and another two hours passed before we reached the edge of the storm. As we approached, we climbed higher and higher, in the hope of getting above it, until at length we had reached very nearly maximum altitude of 10,000 feet but, to our dismay, we found that the storm extended many thousands of feet above this height, the whole region appearing to be riddled with lightning from top to bottom.                                    As the black clouds closed in round us, we began to get terrific bumps from air pockets, and then the rain squalls, which we had come to fear on the Suva - Brisbane flight, tore at us from every direction. So heavy was the onslaught of these terrific sheets of water that I was forced to leave the throttles wide open to keep the engines hot, thus minimising the danger of the plugs becoming wet, and ceasing to function.  In this manner we flew on in a most uncomfortable fashion for about half an hour, when presently, to our consternation, we found that the rain was changing into driving ice. The ‘Southern Cross’ began to labour along under the heavy weight of ice which now coated the wing and all exterior surfaces. We calculated that we had at least an added weight, due to this cause, of about half a ton, and the result was soon apparent. We could not maintain our height; the plane began to sink, and then, to my surprise and dismay, our air speed indicator, on which I relied while thus flying blind, went from 95 miles an hour to zero”.  The instinct of a pilot trained in blind flying - as I have previously mentioned – to believe implicitly in his instruments, in preference to his senses, led me to assume that the machine was stalling.  I pushed the controls forward as far as possible in an endeavour to build up our speed. But nothing happened except the terrific roar of the air past the machine and the steady fall of the altimeter from 8000 feet to 2500 feet. So strongly does his training in blind flying force an airman to believe in his instruments that I had lost all this height before being forced to the conclusion that the indicator had ceased to function.   But why? That puzzled me, until it suddenly dawned on me that it had become choked with ice. I glanced at the engine revolution indicator. It showed 2300 revs per minute instead of 1800. What had happened was this...  We were diving down at a terrific angle and at the enormous speed of 150 M.P.H. or more. Below us and not far below was the angry Tasman Sea. All around us was a black chaotic void, punctuated every few seconds by great jagged rents of lightning which, like vivid green snakes, and seemed to leap at us from every direction.  The only thing I could do was to try to bring the plane on to an even keel. I kept the turn indicator needle at central, and held a constant altitude of 2500 feet by maintaining the engine revolutions at 1800 per minute, pulling the machine up slightly when the revs rose and pushing the plane down when they fell.  All this time we were being bumped about in an inconceivable manner. Many of these terrific jolts must have been two to three hundred feet. Litchfield and McWilliams afterwards told us they had been tossed about like peas and thrown violently all over the rear cabin. And now, to add to the terrors of the situation, we got a hasty note from McWilliams, ‘Lightning put both radio sets out of action’.  Although all this occurred over three years ago, I must confess that that night is still a vivid memory to me. I recollect every detail. I was never so frightened in my life before,  as also were my three companions. Imagine the circumstances.  The reader must remember that we had set off full of confidence on what was, to us, a comparatively short flight. We had left with the information that the weather was good on both sides of the sea, and there seemed no reason to fear that it was not equally fine in the middle. We had run into a series of furious thunder storms from which there seemed to be no escape. All around us nature was waging a terrific warfare, in which she seemed bent on our destruction. Our instruments on which we implicitly relied had played us false. Below us was the roaring main. Above and around us was the roaring storm. The ‘Southern Cross’ was encrusted with ice; our radio had failed; and we were alone on the midst of the deserted Tasman Sea. It was pitch-black; we could see nothing, hear nothing. We did not know where we were. I think that night I touched the extreme of human fear. Panic was very near, and I almost lost my head. I felt a desire to pull her round, dive-climb, to do anything to escape. We were like rats in a trap, terrified, dazed with fear.  All this time, of course, I was flying absolutely blind, without any idea of where we were going, and praying that the bank and turn indicator would not go out of action, too. If it did, we were lost. To add to our fears there was the paralysing and ever present knowledge that we carried 500-600 gallons of petrol. One spark from that terrible lightning.  For the reader must understand that all this time the “Southern Cross” was an immense, electrically charged unit. Not only in the air, but all round the machine were the weirdest and inexplicable static electrically effects.  A particularly vivid flash would outline the three propellers in weird blue light, flinging blue rings of static electricity perhaps 12 inches in thickness. Another discharge of lightning would extinguish them, and there would follow strange lights playing up and down the wing edges. Here I may conveniently insert a word of explanation about the effect of electrical discharges on aircraft. Aeroplanes are unlike ships in that the latter are earthed by contact with the water, whereas there is no escape for electricity with each shaft of lightning would charge the ‘Southern Cross’. Consequently the plane became a huge electric condenser, the only means of discharge being into the air, and giving the static effects which so alarmed us. Every metal part of the machine was “bonded,” making a component whole and thus reducing the risk, of fire, for, if, say a petrol tank was isolated from the remainder of the machine; it would possibly have caught fire.  The violence of the rain and sleet which beat remorselessly against us combined to make the most violent and terrifying storm I have ever experienced. We had lost all count of time in our agony of mind; we had no idea whatever of our position; we were buoyed up only by knowledge that nothing could possibly be worse, and that any change could be only a change for the better.   I personally gained a little comfort from the fact that the altimeter needle remained fairly steady at 2500 feet, and I was further cheered by the knowledge that, at the lower and warmer altitude at which we now were, the ice was slowly melting and relieving the plane of its added weight.  Shortly afterwards the air speed indicator suddenly came to life, the reason being that the plug of ice in the tube was melting and blowing through the system. It now registered the correct speed of 95 miles per hour.  Although there seemed to be no abatement in the fury of the storm, I now began to feel a little happier in my mind. Suddenly we emerged from the ghastly blackness, punctuated by the lightning, into three minutes of comparative calm. On each side and below us, that flashing inferno went on, but we were passing through two great canyon walls of black cloud; again we plunged into maelstrom ahead, but nothing worse befell us. A little later it seemed to me that the storm was weakening.  It was now about three o’clock. We had run into the storm at 11 o’clock on the previous night and now we felt that, whatever happened, every minute was bringing us nearer to the land. All the while those three glorious engines were carrying us on, though at this juncture we had another fright due to a very noticeable vibration in the engines. We found later that this was due to particles of ice having literally torn chunks out of our propeller blades, two on each propeller. The damage was so bad that on arrival in New Zealand we had to cable to Sydney for spare blades before making the return flight.  Now we were definitely leaving the storm behind us, and we were cruising along at an altitude of 6000 feet above the dark tumbled clouds that lay beneath us”.   One could imagine the relief Smithy and his crew felt when a small sign of daylight came. But the memory of the continuous violent storm, flying blind the whole time, could not be forgotten, and during that time every member of the crew must have thought that their fate could be the same as Moncrieff and Hood. To add to their problems during that time, Tom McWilliams passed a note, to Smithy telling him that the storm had completely knocked out both radios and as a result the people in New Zealand were not receiving reports from the “Southern Cross”.  He could rightly believe that perhaps all four of the crew had met the same fate as Moncrieff and Hood.  Smithy mentioned that looking back he saw McWilliams working desperately trying to re-assemble one radio on the cabin floor in an endeavour to again communicate with New Zealand. He did do eventually, but with only limited success. Smithy also had to mention McWilliams’ tenacity and courage while working in such difficult conditions.  The first thing Smithy and Ulm were able to see when daylight came were the faces of each other, which were covered with red marks where particles of ice had been thrown at them from time to time.   They were keen to drop below a continuous blanket of clouds which prevented them from seeing what was below and allow Litchfield to take a bearing. Eventually a clearance in the cloud formation was sufficient for Litchfield to get a rough bearing which turned out to be accurate.  When full daylight came, what lay beneath them looked beautiful, so much so, Smithy handed the controls over to Ulm, and breathed a sigh of relief after what they had been through.  Very soon Litchfield passed a note to Smithy “Watch bank of cloud on starboard bow”. When he looked, it was many miles away, but did not change shape, and finally they concluded that we were gazing on the far distant peaks of the Tasman Range, and a little later they approached the point where Litchfield advised they would soon be over the 100 mile wide entrance to Cook Strait. Smithy with his usual cautious approach  did not want to drop below the clouds in case they were so low that the clouds ahead may be rested on top of some high hills, and they would end their great flight in disaster after all they had been through.  Very soon though, they were able to get under the clouds and they sighted a long peninsula of land which was Cape Farewell, and Smithy congratulated Litchfield because they were right over that part of New Zealand first sighted by Captain Cook - a remarkable testimony to Litchfield’s navigation. It was the entrance to Cook Strait. Instead of flying direct to Christchurch, their destination, they decided it would be a nice gesture to circle around Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, and they were surprised with what they saw below them. The news soon got around that Smithy and his crew had arrived in New Zealand and it was estimated that almost everyone in Wellington at that time were out of their houses waving to them.  After they finished their circle around Wellington they then flew on to Christchurch and on their way, they were greeted 50 miles away from Christchurch by a Bristol Fighter aircraft of the New Zealand Permanent Air Force who escorted them to Wigram Airport. They landed there at 9.30 on the morning of September 11, 1928 after flying for 14 hours and 25 minutes. Smithy described the crowd who greeted him with deafening cheers, as the most enthusiastic crowd he had ever seen.  The spot where the Southern Cross first touched down on New Zealand soil was commemorated by the laying of a tablet by Sir Henry Wigram, known there as “The Father of Aviation”.   Smithy created an enormous interest in aviation in New Zealand and the realisation of what Aviation could eventually do for the country. Although the time taken for that flight, back in 1928 was very slow by the time it takes to cross the Tasman today, it then seemed almost a miracle that someone could leave Australia late in the evening and arrives in New Zealand early the next morning. It has to be remembered, that at that time the only means of transport between the two countries was by boat, which took several days.  Because of this interest, Smithy and his crew were invited by the Government to fly around New Zealand for people to meet them, and they were provided with a Bristol fighter aircraft from the New Zealand Air Force to do this.  After his Pacific flight, along with his record flight across Australia, and now the successful crossing of the Tasman sea, Smithy became a hero in both New Zealand and Australia, and for that reason people wanted to meet the man and his crew. Everywhere they travelled in New Zealand, they were treated as guests of the Government, and they were greeted with a civic reception. They were also received at Trentham by the Prime Minister Mr J.G. Coates, who did everything possible to make their stay in New Zealand so welcome, and the entire Crew were decorated by children with wreaths of laurel.  They received the same reception everywhere they went in New Zealand. Of course, people would have liked to have been able to see the Southern Cross which in those days was a very big aircraft, but there was only a couple of aerodromes where it could land and take off, and secondly the aircraft was grounded until new propellers arrived from Australia.  Smithy said that he would never forget the month’s tour of New Zealand and the extraordinary warmth of the reception they received from the people of the Dominion. He said it was a surprise, because he had never conceived that his flight to New Zealand would create such an impression.  During the time Smithy and Crew were making this tour, the Southern Cross was kept at Wigram aerodrome, Christchurch and the New Zealand Air Force carried out a thorough overhaul of the Southern Cross. They fitted the new propellers which had arrived from Australia to replace the ones damaged by ice. Now everything was ready for the return flight to Australia.    RETURN FLIGHT TO AUSTRALIA  After their experience on the flight to New Zealand they knew that they had to be prepared for any weather they may run into. They were aware of the strong westerly winds that prevail nearly all the year round in the Tasman, and for that reason they decided to take on an extra 200 gallons of petrol which turned out to be a very wise decision. As the runway at Wigram was hardly long enough for the extra weight they had to carry, Smithy accepted an offer from the Marlborough Aero Club to use a ground at Blenheim, where there was ample room. This offer was greatly appreciated by Smithy and he let that be known. After flying there from Wigram and refuelling, all they had to do was wait for a favourable weather report,.  After their experience flying over to New Zealand at night time, they decided to cross the Tasman Sea in daylight, which required an early morning take off. Smithy appreciated the effort of Dr. Kidston (the Director of the New Zealand Weather Bureau) who devoted time and trouble to a study of the weather and the most favourable time for the take-off.   It was Friday October 7, 1928 when Smithy received the news he had been waiting which predicted fine weather, and for that reason it was decided to take off at 5 a.m. the next morning which they did without any problems.  They decided to avoid the hilly country round the sounds, and they headed  for Cape Farewell which they sighted at 6.30 am, and it was from that point they sent out a radio good-bye (as Smithy said) to the kind people of New Zealand.  The very strong westerly wind they predicted could be a problem, was very quickly realised which reduced their speed to 65 mph ground speed, almost after leaving Cape Farewell, and they battled against this storm nearly all way to Australia.  They also had one very big fright when the starboard engine suddenly became quiet, early in the afternoon. This appeared at first to be a very serious problem, and Smithy almost got to the stage of dumping some petrol and returning to the nearest land in New Zealand.  After checking everything that may have caused the roar of the engine to suddenly go quiet, and when Smithy had got to the stage of getting ready to open the petrol dump valves he noticed that the engine switch was off.  What had happened to cause this was when Ulm chilled by the cold, stood up to stretch his muscles, and in doing so he knocked or kicked the switch to the off position. They were only flying at 500 feet, which normally would have been difficult for Smithy to dive to restart the engine, and it would have been impossible to climb higher on only two engines with the heavy load they were carrying. But in this case it was fortunate that the propeller was still revolving, and all went well immediately the switch was switched on.  They were also lucky that there was not the necessity for blind flying on this trip, and they kept as low as possible to minimise the strength of the westerly wind. This also caused some worry for a while, because it limited the long radio aerial to swing. They overcome that problem, but as they still had a third of their journey to go the gale strengthened.  About 11 o’clock Litchfield passed a note to Smithy “Look out for shore lights ahead”. Smithy did see a flashing light about midnight which he thought to be the Sydney South Headlight, but there were no city lights to be seen. Although Litchfield was on course Smithy steered towards the light only to find that they had struck the coast near Newcastle. They immediately flew south following the barely discernible coastline down to the sight of the Sydney lights. From there they had no problem finding their way to Richmond picking roads Smithy knew, which were outlined by car lights. The whole of the aerodrome was surrounded by thousands of motorcars who had come to see the Southern Cross land back at Richmond from where they started from, for the Tasman flight to New Zealand. They landed there just after 2am, taking 23 and 1/2 hours of flying since they left New Zealand. Before Smithy left Richmond he received a telegram from the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr J. Coates) “Hearty congratulations on a successful re-crossing” Smithy then said. “Now we can all go to bed”.  Most people, I am sure, would think that after what Smithy and his crew experienced on the flight across the Tasman, that it would have ended any further attempts by Smithy to carry out any future record attempts, but as Smithy said himself,“Confident in our plane and in ourselves, we began to visualise a flight around the world”.  Although the Tasman crossing was without a doubt, at that time Smithy’s worst flying experience, it was not going to deter him from his ambition to carry out what he and Charles Ulm his then Co-pilot said they visualised - to prove to the world that aviation had a future.   Smithy was a dynamic man and as such would not let any bad experience get in his way as far as flying around the world, because there were still more to show the world what aviation could do and nothing was going to stop him from doing this. It did not matter how frightening it would be, and following the Tasman crossings he made many more great flights including the first aerial circumnavigation of the world with an equatorial crossing.  Smithy’s achievements were all of great significance, but it was from the first Tasman aerial crossing from Australia to New Zealand, that I learned how difficult it was for those early pioneers, and the great risks they took in those pioneering flights. That particular flight was an example of the dangers taken, and it was this flight that had such an influence in my interest in all of Smithy’s pioneering flights. Thus it was stamped on my mind at an early age.     For this reason I will turn the clock back and mention more of his earlier life and the struggle he and his colleagues had before the record flights were made. The transTasman flight was only one of the great numbers of early pioneering flights Smithy made in those early pioneering days, and these were recognised worldwide for his achievements. It is for that reason that I prefer to mention all of his achievements." title="" style="left:42px;top:249px;width:2188px;height:7693px;"/>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 267.61px;">Christchurch in daylight on an aerodrome they had never seen. They were carrying 700 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 286.04px;">gallons of petrol and there were no problems with the take-off. A very careful weather </span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 322.9px;">turned out to be accurate, but this forecast was all they could get because there was no </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 341.33px;">shipping at that time in the middle of the Tasman, that could have given them a true </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 359.77px;">picture of the weather they were to run into. Smithy had already plenty to say about the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 378.2px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">Tasman Sea and what he and his crew might expect, as already mentioned.</span></span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 470.36px;">difficult to believe what Smithy and his crew had to put up with, as far as the weather and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 488.79px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">the time taken was concerned, when they made the first crossing of their Tasman Sea.  </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 525.49px;">In addition the reception Smithy and his Crew received throughout New Zealand would </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 543.93px;">perhaps also be hard to understand today, but this was a time when pioneer flights were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 562.36px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">so important, and to many people hard to accept the future of aviation.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 599.06px;">Smithy did not exaggerate when he later described that experience in the “Old Bus” (the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 617.49px;">story of his many pioneer flights), when he mentioned the notorious weather they ran into. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 635.93px;">When that was first published on the 28</span>

  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 654.36px;">Litchfield his Navigator and Tom Mc Williams his Wireless Operator were very much alive </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 672.79px;">and all had a very good reason to confirm in detail what they experienced. The damaged </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 691.22px;">done to the “Southern Cross” after it landed at Christchurch NZ on that historic flight was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 709.65px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">further evidence of the damage done by the weather.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 746.36px;">As already mentioned, aircraft in those days had no chance of avoiding bad weather </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 764.79px;">because of their inability to fly high enough to get away from it. Smithy, more than anyone </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 783.22px;">else amongst the aviation pioneers had more than his share of flying under difficult </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 801.65px;">weather conditions but his experience on that first Tasman crossing was the very worst. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 820.09px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">What he predicted could happen, did happen.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 856.79px;">The weather aspect mentioned in the “Old Bus” about the first Tasman flight was taken </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 875.22px;">from Smithy’s log book, with further comments about their difficulty in trying to avoid the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 893.65px;">weather they experienced in connection with this flight, and it is from this that I quote what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 912.09px;">Smithy had to say about the weather and the very serious problems this caused them. At </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 930.52px;">one stage they must have thought the extremely bad weather would land them in the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 948.95px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">same fate as Moncrieff and Hood.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 985.65px;">Rather than pluck out parts of this as others have done, I believe the whole of what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1004.09px;">Smithy had to say should be told exactly as he said it and I make no excuse for doing so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1022.52px;">and quoting it in full, because what Smithy had to say will give readers an example of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1040.95px;">risks pioneer flyers had to take in the days, when they could not escape the bad weather </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1059.38px;">they ran into from time to time, and the great risk this was to their lives making those </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1077.81px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">pioneer flights, especially when flying over oceans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1114.52px;">When the “Old Bus” was written three years after the first Tasman flight, Smithy said that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1132.95px;">memories of that Tasman flight were still vivid, and this is exactly what Smithy had to say </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1151.38px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">about the first Tasman flight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1206.36px;">“We buzzed along very well until about 11 o’clock when I noticed a long way ahead the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1224.79px;">flickering of lightning which spread out over such a wide front, that to have avoided it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1243.22px;">would have meant a very wide detour, and consequent loss of time. We debated whether </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1261.65px;">we should go on through it, or whether we should waste time and petrol by going round it. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1280.09px;">Airmen have a dread of lightning, since aeroplanes are not earthed, and in bad electric </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1298.52px;">storms one does not know what to expect. Furthermore, there is still very little information </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1316.95px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">available about the effect of electric storms on aircraft.                                           </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1353.65px;">We flew on, and another two hours passed before we reached the edge of the storm. As </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1372.09px;">we approached, we climbed higher and higher, in the hope of getting above it, until at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1390.52px;">length we had reached very nearly maximum altitude of 10,000 feet but, to our dismay, we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1408.95px;">found that the storm extended many thousands of feet above this height, the whole region </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1427.38px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">appearing to be riddled with lightning from top to bottom.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1445.81px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">                                  </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1464.25px;">As the black clouds closed in round us, we began to get terrific bumps from air pockets, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1482.68px;">and then the rain squalls, which we had come to fear on the Suva - Brisbane flight, tore at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1501.11px;">us from every direction. So heavy was the onslaught of these terrific sheets of water that I </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1519.54px;">was forced to leave the throttles wide open to keep the engines hot, thus minimising the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1537.97px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">danger of the plugs becoming wet, and ceasing to function. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1556.41px;">In this manner we flew on in a most uncomfortable fashion for about half an hour, when </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1574.84px;">presently, to our consternation, we found that the rain was changing into driving ice. The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1593.27px;">‘Southern Cross’ began to labour along under the heavy weight of ice which now coated </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1611.7px;">the wing and all exterior surfaces. We calculated that we had at least an added weight, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1630.13px;">due to this cause, of about half a ton, and the result was soon apparent. We could not </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1648.57px;">maintain our height; the plane began to sink, and then, to my surprise and dismay, our air </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1667px;">speed indicator, on which I relied while thus flying blind, went from 95 miles an hour to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1685.43px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">zero”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1722.29px;">The instinct of a pilot trained in blind flying - as I have previously mentioned – to believe </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1740.73px;">implicitly in his instruments, in preference to his senses, led me to assume that the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1759.16px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">machine was stalling.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1795.86px;">I pushed the controls forward as far as possible in an endeavour to build up our speed. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1814.29px;">But nothing happened except the terrific roar of the air past the machine and the steady </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1832.73px;">fall of the altimeter from 8000 feet to 2500 feet. So strongly does his training in blind flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1851.16px;">force an airman to believe in his instruments that I had lost all this height before being </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1869.59px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">forced to the conclusion that the indicator had ceased to function.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1888.02px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style=""> </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1906.45px;">But why? That puzzled me, until it suddenly dawned on me that it had become choked </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1924.89px;">with ice. I glanced at the engine revolution indicator. It showed 2300 revs per minute </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1943.32px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">instead of 1800. What had happened was this...</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1980.02px;">We were diving down at a terrific angle and at the enormous speed of 150 M.P.H. or more. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 1998.45px;">Below us and not far below was the angry Tasman Sea. All around us was a black chaotic </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2016.89px;">void, punctuated every few seconds by great jagged rents of lightning which, like vivid </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2035.32px;">green snakes, and seemed to leap at us from every direction.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2072.02px;">The only thing I could do was to try to bring the plane on to an even keel. I kept the turn </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2090.45px;">indicator needle at central, and held a constant altitude of 2500 feet by maintaining the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2108.89px;">engine revolutions at 1800 per minute, pulling the machine up slightly when the revs rose </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2127.32px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">and pushing the plane down when they fell.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2164.02px;">All this time we were being bumped about in an inconceivable manner. Many of these </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2182.45px;">terrific jolts must have been two to three hundred feet. Litchfield and McWilliams </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2200.89px;">afterwards told us they had been tossed about like peas and thrown violently all over the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2219.32px;">rear cabin. And now, to add to the terrors of the situation, we got a hasty note from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2237.75px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">McWilliams, ‘Lightning put both radio sets out of action’.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2274.45px;">Although all this occurred over three years ago, I must confess that that night is still a vivid </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2292.89px;">memory to me. I recollect every detail. I was never so frightened in my life before,  as also </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2311.32px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">were my three companions. Imagine the circumstances.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2348.02px;">The reader must remember that we had set off full of confidence on what was, to us, a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2366.45px;">comparatively short flight. We had left with the information that the weather was good on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2384.89px;">both sides of the sea, and there seemed no reason to fear that it was not equally fine in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2403.32px;">the middle. We had run into a series of furious thunder storms from which there seemed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2421.75px;">to be no escape. All around us nature was waging a terrific warfare, in which she seemed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2440.18px;">bent on our destruction. Our instruments on which we implicitly relied had played us false. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2458.61px;">Below us was the roaring main. Above and around us was the roaring storm. The </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2477.05px;">‘Southern Cross’ was encrusted with ice; our radio had failed; and we were alone on the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2495.48px;">midst of the deserted Tasman Sea. It was pitch-black; we could see nothing, hear nothing. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2513.91px;">We did not know where we were. I think that night I touched the extreme of human fear. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2532.34px;">Panic was very near, and I almost lost my head. I felt a desire to pull her round, dive-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2550.77px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">climb, to do anything to escape. We were like rats in a trap, terrified, dazed with fear.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2587.48px;">All this time, of course, I was flying absolutely blind, without any idea of where we were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2605.91px;">going, and praying that the bank and turn indicator would not go out of action, too. If it did, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2624.34px;">we were lost. To add to our fears there was the paralysing and ever present knowledge </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2642.77px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">that we carried 500-600 gallons of petrol. One spark from that terrible lightning.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2679.48px;">For the reader must understand that all this time the “Southern Cross” was an immense, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2697.91px;">electrically charged unit. Not only in the air, but all round the machine were the weirdest </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2716.34px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">and inexplicable static electrically effects.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2753.05px;">A particularly vivid flash would outline the three propellers in weird blue light, flinging blue </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2771.48px;">rings of static electricity perhaps 12 inches in thickness. Another discharge of lightning </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2789.91px;">would extinguish them, and there would follow strange lights playing up and down the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2808.34px;">wing edges. Here I may conveniently insert a word of explanation about the effect of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2826.77px;">electrical discharges on aircraft. Aeroplanes are unlike ships in that the latter are earthed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2845.21px;">by contact with the water, whereas there is no escape for electricity with each shaft of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2863.64px;">lightning would charge the ‘Southern Cross’. Consequently the plane became a huge </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2882.07px;">electric condenser, the only means of discharge being into the air, and giving the static </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2900.5px;">effects which so alarmed us. Every metal part of the machine was “bonded,” making a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2918.93px;">component whole and thus reducing the risk, of fire, for, if, say a petrol tank was isolated </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2937.37px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">from the remainder of the machine; it would possibly have caught fire.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2974.07px;">The violence of the rain and sleet which beat remorselessly against us combined to make </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 2992.5px;">the most violent and terrifying storm I have ever experienced. We had lost all count of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3010.93px;">time in our agony of mind; we had no idea whatever of our position; we were buoyed up </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3029.37px;">only by knowledge that nothing could possibly be worse, and that any change could be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3047.8px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">only a change for the better. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3084.5px;">I personally gained a little comfort from the fact that the altimeter needle remained fairly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3102.93px;">steady at 2500 feet, and I was further cheered by the knowledge that, at the lower and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3121.37px;">warmer altitude at which we now were, the ice was slowly melting and relieving the plane </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3139.8px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">of its added weight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3176.5px;">Shortly afterwards the air speed indicator suddenly came to life, the reason being that the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3194.93px;">plug of ice in the tube was melting and blowing through the system. It now registered the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3213.37px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">correct speed of 95 miles per hour.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3250.07px;">Although there seemed to be no abatement in the fury of the storm, I now began to feel a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3268.5px;">little happier in my mind. Suddenly we emerged from the ghastly blackness, punctuated </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3286.93px;">by the lightning, into three minutes of comparative calm. On each side and below us, that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3305.37px;">flashing inferno went on, but we were passing through two great canyon walls of black </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3323.8px;">cloud; again we plunged into maelstrom ahead, but nothing worse befell us. A little later it </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3342.23px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">seemed to me that the storm was weakening.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3378.93px;">It was now about three o’clock. We had run into the storm at 11 o’clock on the previous </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3397.37px;">night and now we felt that, whatever happened, every minute was bringing us nearer to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3415.8px;">the land. All the while those three glorious engines were carrying us on, though at this </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3434.23px;">juncture we had another fright due to a very noticeable vibration in the engines. We found </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3452.66px;">later that this was due to particles of ice having literally torn chunks out of our propeller </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3471.09px;">blades, two on each propeller. The damage was so bad that on arrival in New Zealand we </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3489.53px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">had to cable to Sydney for spare blades before making the return flight.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3526.23px;">Now we were definitely leaving the storm behind us, and we were cruising along at an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3544.66px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">altitude of 6000 feet above the dark tumbled clouds that lay beneath us”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3599.64px;">One could imagine the relief Smithy and his crew felt when a small sign of daylight came. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3618.07px;">But the memory of the continuous violent storm, flying blind the whole time, could not be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3636.5px;">forgotten, and during that time every member of the crew must have thought that their fate </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3654.93px;">could be the same as Moncrieff and Hood. To add to their problems during that time, Tom </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3673.37px;">McWilliams passed a note, to Smithy telling him that the storm had completely knocked </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3691.8px;">out both radios and as a result the people in New Zealand were not receiving reports from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3710.23px;">the “Southern Cross”.  He could rightly believe that perhaps all four of the crew had met </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3728.66px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">the same fate as Moncrieff and Hood.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3765.37px;">Smithy mentioned that looking back he saw McWilliams working desperately trying to re-</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3783.8px;">assemble one radio on the cabin floor in an endeavour to again communicate with New </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3802.23px;">Zealand. He did do eventually, but with only limited success. Smithy also had to mention </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3820.66px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">McWilliams’ tenacity and courage while working in such difficult conditions.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3857.37px;">The first thing Smithy and Ulm were able to see when daylight came were the faces of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3875.8px;">each other, which were covered with red marks where particles of ice had been thrown at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3894.23px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">them from time to time. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3930.93px;">They were keen to drop below a continuous blanket of clouds which prevented them from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3949.37px;">seeing what was below and allow Litchfield to take a bearing. Eventually a clearance in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3967.8px;">the cloud formation was sufficient for Litchfield to get a rough bearing which turned out to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 3986.23px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">be accurate.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4022.93px;">When full daylight came, what lay beneath them looked beautiful, so much so, Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4041.37px;">handed the controls over to Ulm, and breathed a sigh of relief after what they had been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4059.8px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">through.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4096.5px;">Very soon Litchfield passed a note to Smithy “Watch bank of cloud on starboard bow”. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4114.93px;">When he looked, it was many miles away, but did not change shape, and finally they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4133.37px;">concluded that we were gazing on the far distant peaks of the Tasman Range, and a little </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4151.8px;">later they approached the point where Litchfield advised they would soon be over the 100 </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4170.23px;">mile wide entrance to Cook Strait. Smithy with his usual cautious approach  did not want </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4188.66px;">to drop below the clouds in case they were so low that the clouds ahead may be rested on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4207.09px;">top of some high hills, and they would end their great flight in disaster after all they had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4225.53px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">been through.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4262.23px;">Very soon though, they were able to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4280.66px;">get under the clouds and they sighted</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4299.09px;">a long peninsula of land which was</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4317.53px;">Cape Farewell, and Smithy</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4335.96px;">congratulated Litchfield because they</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4354.39px;">were right over that part of New</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4372.82px;">Zealand first sighted by Captain Cook</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4391.25px;">- a remarkable testimony to Litchfield’s</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4409.69px;">navigation. It was the entrance to Cook</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4428.12px;">Strait. Instead of flying direct to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4446.55px;">Christchurch, their destination, they</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4464.98px;">decided it would be a nice gesture to</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4483.41px;">circle around Wellington, the capital of</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4501.85px;">New Zealand, and they were surprised</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4520.28px;">with what they saw below them. The</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4538.71px;">news soon got around that Smithy</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4557.14px;">and his crew had arrived in New Zealand and it was estimated that almost everyone in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4575.57px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">Wellington at that time were out of their houses waving to them.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4612.28px;">After they finished their circle around Wellington they then flew on to Christchurch and on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4630.71px;">their way, they were greeted 50 miles away from Christchurch by a Bristol Fighter aircraft </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4649.14px;">of the New Zealand Permanent Air Force who escorted them to Wigram Airport. They </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4667.57px;">landed there at 9.30 on the morning of September 11, 1928 after flying for 14 hours and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4686.01px;">25 minutes. Smithy described the crowd who greeted him with deafening cheers, as the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4704.44px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">most enthusiastic crowd he had ever seen.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4741.14px;">The spot where the Southern Cross first touched down on New Zealand soil was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4759.57px;">commemorated by the laying of a tablet by Sir Henry Wigram, known there as “The Father </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4778.01px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">of Aviation”.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4832.98px;">Smithy created an enormous interest in aviation in New Zealand and the realisation of </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4851.41px;">what Aviation could eventually do for the country. Although the time taken for that flight, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4869.85px;">back in 1928 was very slow by the time it takes to cross the Tasman today, it then seemed </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4888.28px;">almost a miracle that someone could leave Australia late in the evening and arrives in </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4906.71px;">New Zealand early the next morning. It has to be remembered, that at that time the only </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4925.14px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">means of transport between the two countries was by boat, which took several days.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4961.85px;">Because of this interest, Smithy and his crew were invited by the Government to fly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4980.28px;">around New Zealand for people to meet them, and they were provided with a Bristol </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 4998.71px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">fighter aircraft from the New Zealand Air Force to do this.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5035.41px;">After his Pacific flight, along with his record flight across Australia, and now the successful </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5053.85px;">crossing of the Tasman sea, Smithy became a hero in both New Zealand and Australia, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5072.28px;">and for that reason people wanted to meet the man and his crew. Everywhere they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5090.71px;">travelled in New Zealand, they were treated as guests of the Government, and they were </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5109.14px;">greeted with a civic reception. They were also received at Trentham by the Prime Minister </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5127.57px;">Mr J.G. Coates, who did everything possible to make their stay in New Zealand so </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5146.01px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">welcome, and the entire Crew were decorated by children with wreaths of laurel.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5182.71px;">They received the same reception everywhere they went in New Zealand. Of course, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5201.14px;">people would have liked to have been able to see the Southern Cross which in those days </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5219.57px;">was a very big aircraft, but there was only a couple of aerodromes where it could land and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5238.01px;">take off, and secondly the aircraft was grounded until new propellers arrived from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5256.44px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">Australia.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5293.14px;">Smithy said that he would never forget the month’s tour of New Zealand and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5311.57px;">extraordinary warmth of the reception they received from the people of the Dominion. He </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5330.01px;">said it was a surprise, because he had never conceived that his flight to New Zealand </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5348.44px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">would create such an impression.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5385.14px;">During the time Smithy and Crew were making this tour, the Southern Cross was kept at </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5403.57px;">Wigram aerodrome, Christchurch and the New Zealand Air Force carried out a thorough </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5422.01px;">overhaul of the Southern Cross. They fitted the new propellers which had arrived from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5440.44px;">Australia to replace the ones damaged by ice. Now everything was ready for the return </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5458.87px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">flight to Australia.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s30 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5532.12px;"><span class="xr_s24 xr_italic xr_underline" style="">RETURN FLIGHT TO AUSTRALIA</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5568.26px;">After their experience on the flight to New Zealand they knew that they had to be prepared </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5586.7px;">for any weather they may run into. They were aware of the strong westerly winds that </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5605.13px;">prevail nearly all the year round in the Tasman, and for that reason they decided to take </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5623.56px;">on an extra 200 gallons of petrol which turned out to be a very wise decision. As the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5641.99px;">runway at Wigram was hardly long enough for the extra weight they had to carry, Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5660.42px;">accepted an offer from the Marlborough Aero Club to use a ground at Blenheim, where </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5678.86px;">there was ample room. This offer was greatly appreciated by Smithy and he let that be </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5697.29px;">known. After flying there from Wigram and refuelling, all they had to do was wait for a </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5715.72px;">favourable weather report,.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5752.42px;">After their experience flying over to New Zealand at night time, they decided to cross the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5770.86px;">Tasman Sea in daylight, which required an early morning take off. Smithy appreciated the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5789.29px;">effort of Dr. Kidston (the Director of the New Zealand Weather Bureau) who devoted time </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5807.72px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">and trouble to a study of the weather and the most favourable time for the take-off. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5844.42px;">It was Friday October 7, 1928 when Smithy received the news he had been waiting which </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5862.86px;">predicted fine weather, and for that reason it was decided to take off at 5 a.m. the next </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5881.29px;">morning which they did without any problems.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5917.99px;">They decided to avoid the hilly country round the sounds, and they headed  for Cape </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5936.42px;">Farewell which they sighted at 6.30 am, and it was from that point they sent out a radio </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5954.86px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">good-bye (as Smithy said) to the kind people of New Zealand.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 5991.56px;">The very strong westerly wind they predicted could be a problem, was very quickly </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6009.99px;">realised which reduced their speed to 65 mph ground speed, almost after leaving Cape </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6028.42px;">Farewell, and they battled against this storm nearly all way to Australia.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6065.13px;">They also had one very big fright when the starboard engine suddenly became quiet, </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6083.56px;">early in the afternoon. This appeared at first to be a very serious problem, and Smithy </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6101.99px;">almost got to the stage of dumping some petrol and returning to the nearest land in New </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6120.42px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">Zealand.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6157.13px;">After checking everything that may have caused the roar of the engine to suddenly go </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6175.56px;">quiet, and when Smithy had got to the stage of getting ready to open the petrol dump </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6193.99px;">valves he noticed that the engine switch was off.  What had happened to cause this was </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6212.42px;">when Ulm chilled by the cold, stood up to stretch his muscles, and in doing so he knocked </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6230.86px;">or kicked the switch to the off position. They were only flying at 500 feet, which normally </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6249.29px;">would have been difficult for Smithy to dive to restart the engine, and it would have been </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6267.72px;">impossible to climb higher on only two engines with the heavy load they were carrying. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6286.15px;">But in this case it was fortunate that the propeller was still revolving, and all went well </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6304.58px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">immediately the switch was switched on.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6341.29px;">They were also lucky that there was not the necessity for blind flying on this trip, and they </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6359.72px;">kept as low as possible to minimise the strength of the westerly wind. This also caused </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6378.15px;">some worry for a while, because it limited the long radio aerial to swing. They overcome </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6396.58px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">that problem, but as they still had a third of their journey to go the gale strengthened.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6433.29px;">About 11 o’clock Litchfield passed a note to Smithy “Look out for shore lights ahead”. </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6451.72px;">Smithy did see a flashing light about midnight which he thought to be the Sydney South </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6470.15px;">Headlight, but there were no city lights to be seen. Although Litchfield was on course </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6488.58px;">Smithy steered towards the light only to find that they had struck the coast near </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6507.02px;">Newcastle. They immediately flew south following the barely discernible coastline down to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6525.45px;">the sight of the Sydney lights. From there they had no problem finding their way to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6543.88px;">Richmond picking roads Smithy knew, which were outlined by car lights. The whole of the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6562.31px;">aerodrome was surrounded by thousands of motorcars who had come to see the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6580.74px;">Southern Cross land back at Richmond from where they started from, for the Tasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6599.18px;">flight to New Zealand. They landed there just after 2am, taking 23 and 1/2 hours of flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6617.61px;">since they left New Zealand. Before Smithy left Richmond he received a telegram from </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6636.04px;">the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr J. Coates) “Hearty congratulations on a successful </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6654.47px;">re-crossing” Smithy then said. “Now we can all go to bed”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6691.18px;">Most people, I am sure, would think that after what Smithy and his crew experienced on </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6709.61px;">the flight across the Tasman, that it would have ended any further attempts by Smithy to </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6728.04px;">carry out any future record attempts, but as Smithy said himself,“Confident in our plane </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6746.47px;">and in ourselves, we began to visualise a flight around the world”.</span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6783.18px;">Although the Tasman crossing was without a doubt, at that time Smithy’s worst flying </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6801.61px;">experience, it was not going to deter him from his ambition to carry out what he and </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6820.04px;">Charles Ulm his then Co-pilot said they visualised - to prove to the world that aviation had </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6838.47px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">a future. </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6875.18px;">Smithy was a dynamic man and as such would not let any bad experience get in his way </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6893.61px;">as far as flying around the world, because there were still more to show the world what </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6912.04px;">aviation could do and nothing was going to stop him from doing this. It did not matter how </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6930.47px;">frightening it would be, and following the Tasman crossings he made many more great </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6948.9px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">flights including the first aerial circumnavigation of the world with an equatorial crossing.</span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 6985.61px;">Smithy’s achievements were all of great significance, but it was from the first Tasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7004.04px;">aerial crossing from Australia to New Zealand, that I learned how difficult it was for those </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7022.47px;">early pioneers, and the great risks they took in those pioneering flights. That particular </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7040.9px;">flight was an example of the dangers taken, and it was this flight that had such an </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7059.34px;">influence in my interest in all of Smithy’s pioneering flights. Thus it was stamped on my </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s33 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7077.77px;"><span class="xr_s32 xr_italic" style="">mind at an early age.   </span></span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7114.47px;">For this reason I will turn the clock back and mention more of his earlier life and the </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7132.9px;">struggle he and his colleagues had before the record flights were made. The transTasman </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7151.34px;">flight was only one of the great numbers of early pioneering flights Smithy made in those </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7169.77px;">early pioneering days, and these were recognised worldwide for his achievements. It is for </span>
  <span class="xr_tl xr_s32 xr_italic" style="left: 0px; top: 7188.2px;">that reason that I prefer to mention all of his achievements.  </span>
